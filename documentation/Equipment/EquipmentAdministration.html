<h1 id="equipment-administration">Equipment administration</h1>

<h2 id="purchase-and-sale-of-equipment">Purchase and sale of equipment</h2>
<p>Equipment can mean an individual item but also a type of which several are present in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Equipment inventories are increased by the purchase of equipment and decreased by sales. The inventory postings occur via the Equipment Journals in the menu</p>
<p><em>Equipment.</em></p>
<p>The setting in the field <em>Equipment Type</em> is decisive here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Option &quot;Purchase (Stock)&quot;: The purchase of equipment for one's own company are shown via this option. This option primarily assists the administration of one's own container inventory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option &quot;Sales (Stock)&quot;: The long-lasting sale of containers from one's own inventory is shown here, meaning when these containers are taken out of service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The journal lines can be posted via the button</p>
<p><em>Buchen</em></p>
<p>or via the function key <strong>F9</strong> .</p>
<p>Following posting of the journal line, equipment ledger entries of the type &quot;Purchase (Stock)&quot; emerge and the posted warehouse inventory can be viewed in the equipment chart of accounts for example.</p>
<p>You can find the equipment chart of accounts at</p>
<p><em>enwis services equipment Reports and analysis Plans
and Schedules charts of equipment account</em></p>
<p>By clicking on the corresponding value in the field <em>Stock Qty.</em> you come to the associated equipment ledger entry.</p>
<h2 id="equipment-movements">Equipment movements</h2>
<p>It is not only possible to show the purchase and sale of equipment via the option field Betriebsmittelart (equipment type) but also various types of equipment movements. The following options are provided: <blank>, Submission, Pick-up, Exchange and Clearance.<p>
<ul>
<li><p>Option &quot;Submission&quot;: Equipment ledger entries of the Submission type designate the transfer of equipment to the customer and thus determine the starting point for the calculation of the rental time period. The equipment ledger entry expresses how much equipment is at the customer's premises. The equipment value entry (rental value entry) on the other hand expresses how long the container has been there</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option &quot;Pick-up&quot;: In principle this works just like Submission but in the opposite direction. An equipment entry is applied by the collection and a rental value entry closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option &quot;Exchange&quot;: A Exchange always means both at the same time: Provision and collection occur in one work step. Therefore the total quantitative inventory of equipment remains unchanged for both the customer and the company. enwis nevertheless administers the exchange of equipment internally as a double process of collection and provision.<br>
Three equipment ledger entries occur for each exchange: one of the Submission type, one of the Pick-up type and one of the Exchange type. The latter is however for purely informational purposes in order to clarify that provision and collection were accomplished within the framework of an exchange.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option &quot;Clearance&quot;: While the equipment types Submission, Pick-up and Exchange have a direct or indirect effect on the rental calculation, the equipment type Clearance is completely separate from the equipment rental. Emptying is handling of equipment which can be invoiced as such. As the continuance of the equipment at the customer's premises is however not affected by this, the emptying does not have an effect on the rental time calculation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="availability-of-equipment">Availability of equipment</h2>
<p>Inventories are only available if they are in the warehouse. If the container is dispatched for one day, then it is not only no longer available on this day but also on the next one and the one after that until it is collected.</p>
<p>A provision has a negative effect on the inventory and thus leads to a reduction of the quantity available.</p>
<p>If a container is collected from a customer's premises, then the inventory is thus increased as is the quantity available.</p>
<p>If a container is dispatched for the purpose of emptying, then this has no effect on the inventory and therefore the availability. In the dispatch of equipment the type of dispatch (provision and collection) is thus of decisive importance for administration of the availability.</p>
<p>In addition to their own containers, waste management companies often work with receptacles which they have hired and borrowed from vendors. This makes the rental of receptacles into a dispatching task. In the course of dispatch of equipment it must additionally be taken into account whether customer or vendor business is involved.</p>
<p>For vendor business the inventory change and therefore the availability behave completely reciprocally to the customer business: a provision (the vendor provides us with a container) has the effect of increasing the inventory, a collection (the vendor picks up his container again) has the effect of reducing the inventory.</p>
<p>The availability of an item of equipment is calculated via the following formula:</p>
<p>Inventory (= purchase quantity – sale quantity) + dispatched rented quantity (= vendor provision – vendor collection) – dispatched rented quantity (= customer provision – customer collection).</p>
<p>The availability overview of equipment can be called from the equipment card via the link Navigate</p>
<p><em>Planning Equipment
availability</em></p>
<p>and also in numerous other dispatch relevant contexts.</p>
<p>Via the fields <em>Stock Quantity</em>, <em>Sales Qty. Dispatched</em> and <em>Sales Qty. Dispatched</em> it is possible to branch directly onto the underlying equipment ledger entries or to the dispatched equipment entries of the corresponding orders. As long as the user has the appropriate entitlements, direct dispatching changes can also be made directly in the orders.</p>

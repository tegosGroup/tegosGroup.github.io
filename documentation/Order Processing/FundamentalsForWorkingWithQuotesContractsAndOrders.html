<h1 id="fundamentals-for-working-with-quotes-contracts-and-orders">Fundamentals for working with quotes, contracts and orders</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>One of the essential properties of enwis is the continuous data flow
which makes the multiple input of data superfluous. All documents build
on one another or pass their data onto the relevant downstream stage of
the business process. A continuous passing on of data occurs between
quotes, contracts, the various order stages and finally the invoices
generated from them which is only added to with additional information
in the course of order processing.</p>
<p>The central data container is never the form header - thus not the
header of quotes, contracts or orders - but in principle the apparently
downstream line. The various lines of a form are completely autonomous
of the header and one another and they contain all data which enwis
requires for the data processing. The form header is essentially only a
user friendly screen which structures the otherwise very unclear and
apparent chaos of the order lines.</p>
<p>This means it is possible to show order components for different
customers and vendors and a mixture of customers and vendors in a
contract or order.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The customer collection of waste from a customer's premises can be put
together with the vendor related transfer to the disposal site.</strong></p>
<p>It is also possible to bundle order entries with reference to any
customer task sites and vendor task sites of the most varied vendors and
customers in a contract or an order.</p>
<p>Quotes, contracts and orders form the basis of the operational business
in enwis. All three forms have a largely analogous structure but very
different functions. They do in principle consist of a header and any
number of lines.</p>
<p>The data of the customer or vendor are consigned in the header. The
lines represent the individual quote, contract or order entries. The
functionalities in the operative business in the customer and vendor
area are largely analogous functionally as they are generally in enwis.
Therefore subsequent reference is made only to customers which can as a
rule be interpreted as &quot;customers and vendors&quot;.</p>
<p>Both billable and non billable services can be defined in the order.
Company internal processes can be shown for example for which nobody is
billed but for which the cost in terms of personnel, material and
machines is to be recorded for cost accounting purposes.</p>
<p>In enwis orders are not just for the depiction of the external and
accounting relevant exchange processes with customer or suppliers but
also for the capture of operationally induced services which are either
not invoiced at all or not invoiced in this form.</p>
<p>The essential difference between contract and order is of a temporal
nature.</p>
<p>The order is a one off action which is carried out on a particular date.
The order can be defined as an interrelated bundling of business
processes which is meaningful in terms of content and time. The order or
the order line is the basis of the dispatching and also the invoicing.
The order thus forms an enclosed operating process and it captures all
the linked costs and proceeds.</p>
<p>In the contract on the other hand a longer term agreement with a
customer or supplier about certain services is consigned. The contract
is used as a copying template for the creation of orders. It already
contains all relevant data - business partners, conditions, services,
prices etc. - which can easily be copied into the order and only need to
be provided with an order date.</p>
<p>The contract always remains present in the system; it can easily be
referred back to.</p>
<p>The order by contrast has been completed once it has been processed and
it should also be deleted as the system is otherwise unnecessarily
bloated.</p>
<p>Orders which have been completed and invoiced are marked with a
corresponding tick so that they cannot be invoiced again.</p>
<p>On posting, the completed order is either deleted, archived or it
remains as a completed order with the notification that it was already
posted.</p>
<p>It is possible to set whether the completed order remains as such
following posting, or it is archived or removed completely in the
<em><strong>Invoice Setup</strong></em> register <span class="smallcaps">general</span> in
the field <em>Del. Compl. Orders on Posting.</em></p>
<p>The posted, completed order is however no longer functional; it cannot
for example be referred back to for the creation of a new order. It
therefore makes sense to make the setting for routine deletion of
completed orders or the archiving of the order when posting.</p>
<p>Orders are the most important document type in enwis. The application
of quotes and contracts is not absolutely necessary in enwis. Orders
must be applied in order to be able to show the business processes in
enwis.</p>
<p>A work flow with a recommended business process is described below.</p>
<h2 id="work-flow-document-flow">Work flow document flow</h2>
<p>The recommended work flow could look as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creation of a contact in the menu <em><span class="smallcaps">sales und
Marketing</span></em> from MS Business Central for the purpose of creating a
quote for potential new customers. This makes sense as only a few
data have to be entered for a contact and the customer list is not
unnecessarily bloated by a number of data sets which may never
result in a business relationship.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creation of a quote for this contact if it involves a potential new
customer or for a customer if he is already listed in the system.
Quotes can be applied under the <span class="smallcaps">enwis Order
Processing <em>waste Producer Processes</em> <em>quotes</em></span>. If a business
relationship comes about via a quote, a customer can be created from
the contact through the push of a button and a contract or an order
can be created from the quote.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Orders or contracts can only be created for customers. If a longer
term agreement with the business partner is involved, a contract
should be created from the quote. Contracts can be applied under the
menu <span class="smallcaps">enwis Order Processing <em>waste Producer
Processes</em> <em>contracts.</em></span> The conversion of a quote into a
contract can largely occur automatically. Contracts can of course
also be applied directly without the presence of a quote. The
contract presents the copy template for the later orders factually.
The order by contrast is the one off implementation of a contract.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a short term business relationship or one off business is
involved, an order can also be created directly from the quote.
Otherwise the contract can be used as a copy template for the repeat
creation of orders. In both processes the order creation is largely
automatic as the order created by pushing a button accepts the
essential data from the basic quote or contract.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Orders can of course be applied directly without prior creation of a
quote or contract. Orders can be applied under the menu <span class="smallcaps">enwis Order Processing <em>waste Producer Processes</em>
<em>orders</em></span>.</p>
<p>It is recommended to work on the basis of contracts in principle as the
system is thereby maintained continuously and it is always possible to
access the same database for evaluations. The associated additional cost
for the copying of orders from contracts is negligible.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the course of order processing, data (e.g. disposed quantity,
vehicles used and employees etc.) can be added and changed. In this
way differences between the originally agreed and the actually
rendered services can be documented.</li>
</ul>
<p>For monitoring of this further order processing and data maintenance the
<em><strong>Order Header</strong></em> has the field <em>Status</em> available on the register
<span class="smallcaps">posting</span>. The following option values are
available in the field <em>Status</em>: Order logging, dispatching, follow up
entry and final control. Whether and how these are used individually can
be stipulated depending on the company.</p>
<p>A work flow control is thus possible within the order
processing/dispatching department. Order logging, dispatching and
control can for example be assigned to various employees or areas for
example which receive the orders presented for processing depending on
the respective status.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Following completion of the logging of an order in the call centre, it
is set to the status <em>Dispostion</em>. Only orders with this status are
dispatched. In the subsequent status <em>Nacherfassung</em> the input of
weighing data and other follow up entries occurs. The order clearance
either occurs immediately or the order is set to the status &quot;Completion&quot;
so that the data captured can be checked once more if necessary.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The order clearance makes every order into a completed order
regardless of its previous status. With the clearance the posting of
the disposed waste or recyclable material quantity to the warehouse
occurs. At the same time the completed order is available for
invoicing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Posting in the general ledger as a result of the clearance does not yet
occur. Therefore the clearance can also easily be withdrawn and
necessary corrections can be added.</p>
<p>The completed order is still in the area upstream of the general ledger.
A cancellation of completed orders is neither necessary nor possible.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It is important to take into account the fact that the quantities posted on the clearance are not cancelled by the withdrawal of the clearance. Waste management, equipment, transport and personnel entries must be cancelled manually where necessary. This applies particularly where the clearance was withdrawn in order to correct these quantity indications. In this case the entry to be corrected must in principle be cancelled before it is corrected and entered once again.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Invoices are generated automatically from all completed orders
through the combine invoicing carried out monthly for example. The
combine invoicing can be called and carried out in the <em><span class="smallcaps">menu enwis invoicing combing invoicing combing
invoicing</span></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These invoices are not compulsorily entered first of all and can instead
be checked as pro-forma invoices, agreed with the recipient where
appropriate and also deleted once again where required.</p>
<p>If this appears too inconvenient, the combine invoices can also be used
to create directly posted invoices if people wish to rely on the fact
that the orders already contain the correct data.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is however recommended to only create the actual invoice
following the final check of the pro-forma invoice by posting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The posting of costs and proceeds in the general ledger accounts and the
formation of process cost ledger entries occurs at the same time.</p>
<p>An invoiced order can be deleted. The movements connected with the
invoicing on the general ledger accounts can however be cancelled if
necessary. The accounting effects of a final invoiced order cannot be
removed from the system without trace in line with the principles of
appropriate bookkeeping and this can only be done by making the
cancellation retrogressive. In this way the originally created ledger
entries remain in the accounts.</p>

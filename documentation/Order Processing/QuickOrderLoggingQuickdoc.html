<h1 id="quick-order-logging--quickdoc">Quick order logging / QuickDoc</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>enwis QuickDoc allows comfortable order logging. A focus is a targeted user guidance which limits the input possibilities and thus also reduces the possibility of incorrect entries.</p>
<p>The aim of the quick order logging is to specify a fixed, step by step work flow for the various types of order (e.g. equipment orders, waste management orders, ...) which guide the user and with which 80-90% of all orders can be processed. All the information required is made available to the user within this fixed work flow. There is the possibility of changing to the standard order form at any time where all functions of the waste management solution are available in case the processing of a special order makes more complex inputs necessary.</p>
<p>The work flow focused starting point is the one which a customer calls in the dispatching, order processing or internal sales service when he wishes to place an order. It must be possible for the case worker to find the customer in the system as quickly as possible without any difficulties. The customer task site plan is the suitable tool for this.</p>
<p>The customer task site plan contains all task sites ordered by customers. The base task sites (the customer as it were) are in bold. All associated task sites are slightly indented below.</p>
<p>The use of QuickDoc together with the customer task site plan is of course particularly meaningful but it is not the only possibility. QuickDoc can also be started directly from the menus and from contracts and orders. Four different cases are to be distinguished when using QuickDoc:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calling directly from the menus</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Waste
producer processes</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>waste
disposal processes
.</em> Here there are no further data available to QuickDoc. It is opened virtually empty.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Calling from the customer task site plan without branching into the contract lines beforehand. The data of the customer and the task site are available to QuickDoc and various QuickDoc forms for the application of various order types are available (depending on the selection of the dispatching code).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calling from the customer task site plan after one or several contract lines were selected beforehand. Data from the contract lines are thus loaded into the QuickDoc form and they can be checked and/or processed. Possible changes to the contract data are transferred into the order according to the default of the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>QuickDoc can also be opened from the standard contract or order form via the link</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Aktionen create
QuickDoc</em></p>
<p>. QuickDoc then presents a comfortable input screen which makes it possible for the user to switch between the customary line presentation and screen view.</p>
<p>The <em>Dispatching Codes</em> are of central importance for work with QuickDoc. Dispatching codes are set up in the <em>Menu enwis Workflow
/administration
/dispatching Codes</em></p>
<p>. They can be consigned in services or contracts or selected via QuickDoc. The set up of dispatching codes is described in a separate document.</p>
<h2 id="standard-process">Standard process</h2>
<p>The standard process for working with QuickDoc looks as follows:</p>
<p>The order acceptance agent or the dispatcher selects the correct branch, office,... of the customer, opens the associated contract line and carries out the function</p>
<p><em>make order from
complete contract</em></p>
<p>. In this way a QuickDoc form which matches the contract line is faded in, namely the one which is determined by the dispatching code consigned in the contract line.</p>
<p>QuickDoc can however also be activated from the customer task site plan without reference to contract lines. There is the possibility of generating various types of orders in the header of the customer site task plan.</p>
<p>If QuickDoc is called from the contract lines it specifies which dispatching code is responsible for the appearance of the QuickDoc form. If this reference is missing, this information must come from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Therefore the correct QuickDoc form must be activated via the various buttons or the buttons must be allocated to the dispatching codes. This occurs via the work flow types.</p>
<p>These functions are also available from the contract lines of a customer task site in an analogous fashion. In the standard option the QuickDoc reverts back to the dispatching code consigned in the contract and offers the corresponding QuickDoc form for further processing.</p>
<p>The calling of QuickDoc from the contract lines is recommended as a standard process for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It is very easy to use the customer task site plan to select the customer and the relevant customer task site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If branching then occurs via the contract lines, the service catalog defined for this customer or the customer task site, in other words the contract lines, can be viewed and used as a template for the creation of an order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is the easiest way to create a connection between the contract and the order when using QuickDoc. It is only possible to use the contract to see which orders for this contract have already been created if QuickDoc is called with reference to contract lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This process allows a strict separation between the contract and price maintenance by sales and the simple order logging. The user in the order logging can view the contracts but has no possibility of changing them. Possibilities for deviating from the defaults of the contract can be controlled via the dispatching code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to use this function, dispatching codes are to be applied with the document type <em>contract</em>. The settings on the registers <em>Selection</em> and <em>Transfer</em> of the dispatching card are also important.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of disconnecting contract line and QuickDoc form from one another. This is useful if there is not yet a suitable contract line for the customer task site and an order nevertheless needs to be created.</p>
<p>Then the order agent or dispatcher could select any contract line of the customer in the customer site plan and create a waste management order with reference to an equipment line for example and the reverse. In this case the order must be created via the function</p>
<p><em>service order</em></p>
<p>. If a suitable dispatching code is present, a waste management order is generated, regardless of the defaults in the contract line.</p>
<p>Dispatching codes which define suitable QuickDoc forms for this special application must have the document type <em>Contract</em> and have a tick in the field <em>Force Workflow</em>. Then the dispatching code forces a QuickDoc form which differs from the contract line.</p>
<h2 id="order-application-via-quick-doc">Order application via Quick-Doc</h2>
<h3 id="use-of-quickdoc-from-the-menu-interface">Use of QuickDoc from the menu interface</h3>
<p>If QuickDoc is opened directly from the interface of the menu</p>
<p><em>Waste producer processes</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>Waste disposal processes</em></p>
<p>, there is first of all now information about the customer, the contract, the service or the dispatching code available. The QuickDoc form is opened empty:</p>
<p>It is only when a dispatching code (document type = Order) defined for this purpose is selected manually in the field <em>Dispatching Code</em> that the form is shaped in a way with which meaningful work can take place:</p>
<p>Here the necessary data (e.g. customer, customer task site, service, equipment,...) can be input successively for the order logging:</p>
<p>If the order logging is completed with &quot;OK&quot;, the user receives the following message:</p>
<p>enwis has created a standard order form in the background:</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>No price processing can occur in the QuickDoc form. Prices cannot be viewed there either. Price maintenance occurs completely separately from the order logging and invisibly for those employees who work exclusively with QuickDoc. Prices are in principle automatically extracted from the service price table and written into the standard order form.<br>
The use of QuickDoc requires particularly thorough price maintenance as the price fixing thus removes control from the user. In the aftermath checks need to take place in the order created regarding whether a price has been fixed for each order line.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="use-of-quickdoc-out-of-the-customer-task-site-plan-without-contract-lines-reference">Use of QuickDoc out of the customer task site plan without contract lines reference</h3>
<p>QuickDoc can be started in the customer task site plan without branching into the contract lines allocated to the customer task sites beforehand. The following options are available in the header of the customer task site plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Default Order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service Order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposal Order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Equipment Order</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An individual dispatching code must be set up for each of the four order types if these buttons are to be used. The linking between the buttons and the dispatching codes is created via the field Workflow type on the dispatching card.</p>
<p>When setting up the dispatching codes allocated to these buttons, it is necessary to consider the direction in which the data input will normally occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In principle if the service is input first (e.g. because the service catalog is well structured and present for the user as a rule), the field <em>Filter Service No. Lookup by</em> is to be set to the option <em>leer</em> in the dispatching code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If on the other hand the concrete data such as e.g. equipment or waste type are captured from the corresponding catalogs and in the QuickDoc form, the field <em>Filter Service No. Lookup by</em> could be used to select one of the options <em>Material, Equipment</em> or <em>Both</em>. With this setting enwis establishes the appropriate service on the basis of the data already captured.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-of-quickdoc-from-the-order-lines-in-the-customer-task-site-plan">Use of QuickDoc from the order lines in the customer task site plan</h3>
<p>From the contract lines of the customer task site plan QuickDoc is as a rule called up via the function create order
from contract.</p>
<p>In this way a QuickDoc form suitable for the contract line is opened. The appearance of this form is determined by the dispatching code which is consigned in the contract line.</p>
<p>In addition the following functions are also available which provide a completely different scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create Default Order from Contract</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create Service Order from Contract</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create Disposal Order from Contract</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create Equipment Order from Contract</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions are provided to generate orders although no suitable order line has been consigned in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Example: A customer rings up and orders a container. Up until this point only waste management services have been contractually agreed with him and consigned in enwis.</strong></p>
<p>In this case the user could use the function</p>
<p><em>create equipment order from contract</em></p>
<p>and apply a corresponding order separate from any contract reference.</p>
<p>For this purpose dispatching codes of the document type <em>Contract</em> are necessary, for which the field <em>Force Workflow</em> is ticked. In addition this dispatching code must show a work flow type which is suitable for the function button (e.g. create waste management order from contract work flow type waste management).</p>
<p>This means a maximum of one dispatching code is to be set up for each function button. With this dispatching code it is possible to override the dispatching code of the contract line and to open and process a QuickDoc form which is independent of the contract line.</p>
<p>Not all contract lines are shown in the contract lines overview however, but just those which have been marked as relevant for the processing via the customer task site plan by e.g. the internal sales service or the case worker responsible for the contract. In this way it is possible to define complementary services in the contract (e.g. maintain movement form or vendor counter postings) which can be automatically transferred into a new order via the subcontract number but which do not appear in the dispatching overview of the contract lines. This marking occurs in the contract via the field <em>Dispatching Code</em>. Only contract lines with a dispatching code are shown in the customer task site plan. Contract lines which are not to be shown in the customer task site plan must show a value <em>leer</em> in the field <em>Dispatching Code</em>. The contract lines are shown arranged by dispatching code in the customer task site plan.</p>

<p>The link</p>
<p>_Actions
create _</p>
<p>provides the user with the possibility of creating a concrete order via the contract lines overview. In doing so he has a choice of six alternatives:</p>
<h3 id="create-immediate-order-from-contract">Create Immediate Order from Contract</h3>
<p>A new order is created directly from the current contract line. No additional inputs are required. The system decides automatically the way in which the new order is created:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the user has marked several lines in the contract lines overview, all marked lines form the basis for the order which is to be newly created</p>
</li>
<li><p>if no line is marked, then only the contract line where the cursor is currently located is decisive</p>
</li>
<li><p>if a contract line contains a subcontract number, then all contract lines with the same subcontract number form the order which is to be newly created</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new order is generated automatically in the background. The user receives a message which states which new order was created from which contract. Via the link</p>
<p><em>Show last
Document</em></p>
<p>it is subsequently possible to branch to the newly created order and make further entries where necessary.</p>
<h3 id="create-order-from-contract-ctrl-u">Create order from contract (Ctrl +U)</h3>
<p>The dispatching code is established via the current contract line (see above for explanation) and the relevant QuickDoc form is shown. The system distinguishes via the dispatching codes consigned in the contract whether e.g. an equipment order or waste management order is involved in the order to be created.</p>
<p>There is no reason not to work with this option in principle as the user always receives the correct QuickDoc form.</p>

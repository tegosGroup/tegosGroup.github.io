<h1 id="the-task-site-plan">The task site plan</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>The task site plan is the most frequently used enwis tool for order logging. It accelerates the order processing and makes a stronger separation between the administrative and operational area possible. The functions described below are also available analogously for the vendors and vendor task sites without this continuing to be mentioned explicitly.</p>
<p>The various locations, branches, depots etc. of the customers are designated as customer task sites. Any number of customer task sites can be consigned for each customer. There always needs to be just one customer applied even if services are performed for it at various locations.</p>
<p>The customer task site plan does in principle meet three different functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>it provides the operation with a customer independent overview of all customer task sites in terms of content which is optically structured</p>
</li>
<li><p>it allows the processing of existing customer task sites and the application of new ones without the customer card having to be viewed or branched out to. Administration and accounting on the one hand and order logging on the other can be separated from one another without any problems. In this way writing permission can only be granted to the administration on parts of the customer task site plan e.g. customer card and order logging</p>
</li>
<li><p>it is the starting point for a quick order logging and it assists the operational area as an optimum starting point for customer calls. It assists the order logging as an information source for the quick detection of customers and the managed application of orders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following types of customer task sites are distinguished:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customer base task sites</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operational customer task site</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In line with the example of the contacts in the marketing module the type <em>Customer</em> or the type <em>task site</em> can be allocated to each customer task site. It can however only be allocated to one customer task site per customer of the type <em>customer</em>. The customer task site with the type <em>Customer</em> is to be understood as a customer base task site which functions as a heading in the customer task site plan and to which the operational customer task sites are allocated.</p>
<p>Customer base task sites are displayed in bold in the customer task site plan. Customer base task sites are to be applied and used exclusively as a structural element. The operational business should be processed on the &quot;normal&quot; customer task sites.</p>
<h2 id="application-of-customer-task-sites">Application of customer task sites</h2>
<p>It is recommended that at least two customer task sites are applied for each customer: a customer base task site and an operational customer task site. Both are identical with the customer. The customer base task site should in principle be blocked for operational processes. Operational customer task sites can be incorporated into the customer task site plan in any amount.</p>
<p>enwis provides a routine which makes the creation of customer base task sites and operational customer task sites easier. From the customer card there is a possibility via the link actions</p>
<p><em>create
create base task site</em></p>
<p>of starting a batch process which applies the two recommended customer task sites for each customer automatically (customer base task site and 1. operational customer task site).</p>
<p>Before the start of this batch process a few default settings must still be made in the set up.</p>
<p>In the register Numbering
of the <strong><em>waste management set up</em></strong> the number series for the customer task sites must be consigned first of all. The fields <em>Cust. Task Site Nos., Base Cust. Task Site Nos.</em> are relevant for the customer area and <em>Vend. Task Site Nos.</em> and <em>Base Vend. Task Site Nos.</em> for the vendor area.</p>
<p>In this context a particular significance is attached to the field <em>Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site.</em> With these fields there are three different systems for the numbering of customer and vendor task sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer base task sites and operational customer task sites access the same number series and are therefore numbered consecutively regardless of their different status. If this is desired, the same number series must be consigned in the fields <em>Cust. Task Site Nos.</em> and <em>Base Cust. Task Site Nos.</em> The field <em>Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site</em> must</li>
</ol>
<p><u>not</u></p>
<p>have a tick in it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>In order to emphasise the difference of the two customer task site types, various number series can be consigned for the base and operational customer task sites. The numbering of both customer task site types then occurs independently of one another.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to emphasise the equality of customer base task site and customer the field <em>Cust./Vend.No. is Base Site</em> can have a tick placed by it. Then each customer base task site receives the number of the associated customer automatically. This is the recommended standard configuration of the customer task site plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It does however only function if the customer numbers have a maximum of ten digits as the customer task site number may only be ten digit.</p>
</div>
<p>The method of the batch processing and thus also the basic structure of the customer task site plan must be defined in the set up of the menu <em>enwis Dispatching
/ Dispatching/ Administration
/Setup
/Dispatching
Setup
)</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is possible to use the option field <em>Auto Create First Task Site</em> to define whether and in which way an operational customer task site is in principle applied in addition to the base task site.</p>
<p>The following options can be selected:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Never</th>
<th>The first operational customer/vendor task site is in principle not applied</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vendor Task Site)</td>
<td>A first operational vendor task site is only applied for vendors. No first operational customer task site is applied for customers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer Task Site)</td>
<td>A first operational customer task site is only applied for customers. No first operational customer task site is applied for vendors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>always</td>
<td>The first operational customer/vendor task site is also applied if this is possible</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The field <em>Base Mask Ext. Task Site</em> decides whether the services of all customer task sites of a customer are displayed or only the services (contract lines) of the selected customer task site on displaying the contract lines of a customer task site. Even if this field is set to the value &quot;Yes&quot; and it is thus specified that only the services of the current customer task site are to be displayed, the remaining services of the customer are displayed very easily. Via the function</p>
<p><em>Clear Filter</em></p>
<p>all remaining services of the customer can be displayed.</p>
<p>The field <em>Base Task Site Mandatory</em> can be used to specify that operational customer task sites for a customer can only be applied if a customer base task site already exists. If the field is ticked it is not possible to apply an operational customer task site for a customer for which there is not yet a customer base task site.</p>
<p>With the help of this function it is possible to control so that the customer can only be used operationally via the quick order logging if it was cleared by applying of the customer base task site for set up of operational customer task sites.</p>
<p>With the fields <em>Copy Address to Base Task Site</em> it is possible to specify whether the customer base task site is provided with a postal address.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>As the customer base task sites only represent structural elements for the customer task site plan it is recommended that they are not furnished with an address. The address data would only disrupt a search for addresses.</p>
</div>
<p>The field <em>Block Base Task Site</em> can be used to define blocking modalities. As customer base task sites only represent a purely structural element and are not used operationally, they should in principle be blocked. The following options can be selected:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Manual</th>
<th>The customer base task site is not blocked automatically. Blocks must be made and reversed manually in the customer task site plan</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Default</td>
<td>The customer base task site is blocked automatically on application. It can however be unblocked again</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Always</td>
<td>The customer base task site is blocked automatically on application and it cannot be unblocked again manually</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After the parameters for the batch processing for generation of customer task sites have been defined, the link actions</p>
<p><em>create
create base task site</em></p>
<p>can be used from the customer card to generate customer base task sites and operational customer task sites.</p>
<p>In this only customer task sites are in principle applied which are not yet present in the system. If a customer base task site was already allocated to a customer, it does not receive a second one via the batch processing. The first operational customer task sites are only applied for the customers which do not yet have any.</p>
<p>Following completion of the batch processing, enwis issues a message regarding how many customer base task sites and first operational customer task sites were generated.</p>
<p>A customer task site plan generated according to the standard process would look as follows:</p>
<p>The customer task site plan contains all task sites ordered by customers. The base task sites (the customer as it were) are in bold. All associated task sites are slightly indented below.</p>
<p>Each customer base task site is provided with the number of the corresponding customer here. The customer base task sites do not contain any address data. A first operational customer task site is applied automatically to each customer base task site which refers back to its own number series and also includes the address data of the customer. Additional offices, branches...were not yet shown. This can occur manually via the customer task site plan.</p>
<p>Such additional customer task site plans can be created via the button new task site
directly from the customer task site plan.</p>
<p>The customer task site is inserted into the customer task site plan where the cursor is located. In this way it is automatically allocated to the corresponding customer.</p>
<h2 id="task-site">Task site</h2>
<p>In its structure the customer task site card is similar to the customer card and provides comparable functionalities to this, albeit with a reduced scope. A difference between customer and customer task site card is that there is no connection from the customer task site card to the enwis marketing module.</p>
<p>Only the particular aspects of the customer task site card in comparison with the customer card are dealt with below.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Shipping Agent Code, Driver No.</em> and <em>Territory Code</em> originate from the standard of Business Central and are normally not used in enwis.</p>
<p>The field <em>Registration No</em>. is needed within the framework of notifications. The approval process for international shipment of waste according to the EC Waste Shipment Regulation is designated as notification. The register number is a process related number for the waste creator. The waste creator can apply for registration numbers from its responsible authority in order to use these for the recording of company internal waste management processes.</p>
<p>With the fields <em>Reference to Mun. Customer</em> or <em>Reference to Mun. Object</em> the enwis module can be used to display the commercial contract lines for a customer, meaning if the customer is consigned as both a communal and a commercial customer in enwis.</p>
<p>In the fields <em>Distance</em> and <em>Duration</em> on the register card waste management
the spatial and time distance to the customer task site can be consigned.</p>
<p>The three option fields <em>Waste Compare Type, EWC Compare Type</em> and <em>Service Compare Type</em> refer to the enwis compare catalog functionality. Both a positive and a negative catalog can be consigned to each customer task site and also each warehouse location.</p>
<p>Each catalog can also refer to the three feature classifications Waste material, EWC number and Service type). In concrete terms this means that a positive catalog can be compiled for a customer task site which contains the services which can be performed there and which also lists the waste materials and/or the EWC numbers which may be transported away from there.</p>
<p>Conversely a negative catalog can be compiled which contains exactly the services, waste materials and EWC numbers which may never be provided for this customer task site and which may never be picked up from there. enwis can be set in such a way that an adjustment between orders being carried out and the catalogs consigned occurs automatically. Whether work with a positive or negative catalog is to take place can be decided for each customer task site or storage location on the basis of the method for which the input time is lower. If only a few services are defined for the customer, a positive catalog is provided. If the customer can obtain all services apart from a few, a negative catalog appears to make more sense.</p>
<p>Corresponding positive and negative catalogs must be consigned to the customer task sites so that this function can be used.</p>
<p>Whether an adjustment between potential orders and the consigned catalogs is to be initiated automatically and manually is defined on the customer task site card via the three option fields <em>Waste Compare Type, EWC Compare Type</em> and <em>Service Compare Type.</em></p>
<p>There are four options available for each of the three feature classifications Waste Material, EWC and Service Type:</p>
<p><em>Blank</em> means: no automatic adjustment occurs even if catalogs were consigned. If an adjustment is desired, this must be started manually from the order.</p>
<p>Via the two options <em>Positive Cataloge / Negative Cataloge</em> it is specified that an automatic adjustment is to take place first of all if this customer task site is touched upon by the application of contracts, quotes or orders and that secondly the selected catalog is to be used.</p>
<p>The option &quot;<em>Both</em>&quot;starts an automatic adjustment for which both catalogs are used. It may initially make little sense to work with both a positive and also a negative catalog for the same customer or vendor task site and even to have both checked where necessary but it can be helpful in practice.</p>
<p>It is definitely conceivable that the positive catalog is not correct or is even updated cyclically so that missing materials can be managed or delivered there if necessary.</p>
<p>On the other hand an entry in the negative catalog should make clear that certain materials may not be disposed of for this customer under any circumstances or certain services be obtained by a supplier under any circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-the-customer-task-site-plan">Working with the customer task site plan</h2>
<p>The customer task site plan allows a quick identification of customers and their locations (customer task sites). It makes all relevant documents and data available for the generation of new orders.</p>
<p>A new customer task site can be applied via the button new Customer task site
. The customer task site is allocated to the same customer as the customer task site on which the cursor is currently located. A new customer task site is applied and the corresponding new customer task site plan is faded in for further processing.</p>
<p>All relevant information is available directly from the overview of all customer task sites in the header of the customer task site plan.</p>
<p>The quote, contract and order lines among other things for this customer task site can be called up via this link. And the current receptacle and rental inventories and the dispatched receptacles/containers for this customer task site.</p>
<p>The customer task site plan is normally the most important tool for the order logging. The following possibilities are available to the user:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Call up and processing of all price and discount information</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overview of the the current receptacle inventory or the dispatched receptacles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Access to all documents consigned in enwis (quotes, contracts, orders,...) for this customer task site</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quote, contract and order lines are presented as so-called customer task site lines. The original context of the document is closed and appears as document lines belonging to the customer task site.</p>
<p>Quote, contract and order lines of the current customer task site are displayed in red.</p>
<p>From this line view it is possible to access the underlying document via the link show document
and this can still be changed if necessary.</p>
<p>Via the link</p>
<p><em>Navigate</em></p>
<p>it is possible to view or consign additional information on the customer task site (e.g. service errors and texts preceding and following invoices). This information is identical to that which can be called up via the customer card.</p>
<p>The essential function of the customer task site plan is however the quick order logging through which a new order can be very easily created in an input screen which can be individually shaped on the basis of the contract lines present.</p>
<h2 id="dispatching-overview-of-the-contract-lines-of-a-customer-task-site">Dispatching overview of the contract lines of a customer task site</h2>
<p>All contract lines to the current customer task site can be called up from the customer task site plan via the button contract Lines
.</p>
<p>In enwis contract lines are the services defined for the respective customer or customer task site. The contract lines represent the individual service catalog for the respective customer task site. Here it can actually involve lines of an existing contract but this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>It is possible to present the contract lines as the section relevant for the customer from the complete service catalog. All the relevant information (e.g. receptacle type, waste transfer note...) can be provided for these services on the contract line so that they are immediately available in the contract lines overview. In addition further information in the form of line observations can also be consigned.</p>
<p>A work flow is the basis for this procedure. The work flow assumes that the sales and marketing department makes agreements with each customer about the services to be performed and fixes the price of them. The operational area (order acceptance or dispatching) should then only access these defined services. If the customer requires further services, these must first of all be offered by the sales and marketing department and consigned in enwis in the form of a contract line.</p>
<p>This procedure is not compulsory; in principle all services can of course be recorded and performed for each customer in each order. But it is a prerequisite for optimum use of the controlled quick order logging. It can be made compulsory for individual users or operational areas if a comprehensive, independent order logging is not to be enabled.</p>
<p>If the contract lines for a customer task site are called up via the link</p>
<p><em>Contract lines</em></p>
<p>in the header of the customer task site plan, these are displayed in their own contract lines overview of the quick order logging. The contract lines of the current customer task site are displayed in red. The other customer task sites of the current customer are presented in normal script.</p>
<p>Whether the services of all customer task sites in the page shown above are displayed on displaying the form or just the services of the selected customer task site is controlled in the dispatching setup
via the field <em>Base Mask Ext. Task Sites.</em></p>
<p>Even if this field is set to the value &quot;Yes&quot; and it is thus determined that only the services of the current customer task site are to be displayed, the remaining services of the customer can be displayed very easily if all filters are released. <em>(Actions
Page
Clear Filter
or Ctrl + Shift + A
)</em>.</p>
<p>It is possible for the user to also work with the contract lines which have not been marked in red (contract lines of other task sites of the current customer) if the correct customer task site is not found straight away.</p>

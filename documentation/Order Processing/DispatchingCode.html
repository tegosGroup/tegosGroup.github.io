<h1 id="dispatching-code">Dispatching Code</h1>

<h2 id="dispatching-codes--general">Dispatching codes – General</h2>
<p>The dispatching codes are of central importance for work with QuickDoc. Dispatching codes are set up in the menu</p>
<p><em>enwis
Workflow/administration/dispatching code</em></p>
<p>. They can be consigned in services or contracts or selected via QuickDoc.</p>
<p>The following is controlled via the dispatching codes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The appearance of the form for the quick order recording, meaning which fields are displayed in this form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The possibility of data input, meaning whether the user can just view the fields or also change them or make inputs in a few fields (so called mandatory fields)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dispatching codes with the document type <em>Order</em> can be used directly from the menu interface or from the customer task sites</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><u>without</u></p>
<p>referring back to the contract or order.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Dispatching codes with the document type <em>Contract</em> can</li>
</ol>
<p><u>only</u></p>
<p>be called up from the contract form or from the customer task site plan with reference to the contract lines.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Dispatching codes control which contract lines are displayed in the customer task site plan. Only contract lines with a dispatching code are displayed in the customer task site plan and are available for processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sequence in which the contract lines in the customer task site plan are shown</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data transfer from the contract into the order. When using QuickDoc an order is generated from the selected contract lines with which all data from the contract are initially transferred into the order. QuickDoc provides the possibility of overwriting, adding to or deleting the data (depending on the system setting) and these changes can be written into the order. The dispatching code controls whether and which data the user may change and what effect the changes made have on the order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the many possibilities of use for QuickDoc and the dispatching codes which must be matched to it, it is necessary to consider carefully prior to setting up the dispatching codes how QuickDoc is to be used and in which master data the dispatching code is to be consigned where appropriate.</p>
<p>The recommended standard work flow for this would be to assign a dispatching code to all services which are then consigned in the contracts and displayed in the customer task site plan via the contract lines. In this way it is ensured that each contract line receives a dispatching code and it also guarantees that all contract lines are shown in the customer task site plan.</p>
<h2 id="dispatching-code---general-set-up">Dispatching code - General set up</h2>
<p>One significant aspect in the setting up of dispatching codes is that the sequence of the contract lines in the customer task site plan is aligned to the alphanumeric code of the dispatching code. In principle the display of the contract lines in the customer task site plan is sorted according to the dispatching codes. The contract as a bundle of contract lines broken up into its component parts and newly arranged.</p>
<p>In order to achieve meaningful sorting, the dispatching codes can each be designated an alphanumeric code which ensures that the waste management lines do in principle appear first for example. Any number of dispatching codes can be set up.</p>
<h2 id="dispatching-code-card">Dispatching code card</h2>
<h3 id="dispatching-code---general-register">Dispatching code - General register</h3>
<p>The fields of the register card general
individually:</p>
<p>The field <em>Document Type</em> is used to define which document type the dispatching code refers to. QuickDoc forms which are to be opened from contract lines must have a dispatching code with the document type = <em>Contract</em>. QuickDoc forms which are to be used without reference to a contract must have a dispatching code with the document type = <em>Order.</em></p>
<p>The option field <em>Dispatching Batch Lines</em> can be used to define a sequence of dispatching codes which determines a sequence of QuickDoc forms which must be processed consecutively by the user.</p>
<p>If this function is to be used, dispatching codes must be applied first of all which are to be incorporated into a batch. Via the link</p>
<p><em>Navigate
dispatching
dispatching
batch lines</em></p>
<p>additional dispatching codes can be assigned to the batch dispatching code. In this way an equipment line is first of all applied for processing of the subsequent dispatching batch and then a waste management line is applied in the order form.</p>
<p>The corresponding QuickDoc forms are offered consecutively for processing which lead to generation of the corresponding order lines. The QuickDoc forms generated from a dispatching batch all lead to the same order.</p>
<p>The field <em>Dispatching Batch</em> has the following options:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Disabled</th>
<th>The dispatching code does not contain a batch or this is ignored. Even if additional dispatching batch lines were assigned to the code, these are not addressed when calling up the dispatching code.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Active incl.</td>
<td>The dispatching code contains a dispatching code batch. In this process the &quot;cover sheet&quot;, meaning the dispatching code, to which the batch is attached is also taken into consideration. If the dispatching code is called up, the corresponding QuickDoc form is opened first of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Active excl.</td>
<td>In this option there is a jump straight into the batch, into the subordinate dispatching batch lines. In this process the dispatching code, to which the batch is attached is bypassed. When calling up the dispatching code, the QuickDoc form is opened first of all to which the number 1 was assigned in the batch via the field <em>Sequence</em> (order).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the field <em>Start with Service No</em>. is ticked on the dispatching card, then the service number does in principle appear first under the header in the QuickDoc form.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The service number is in principle characterised as a mandatory field by QuickDoc. It is not possible to generate an order in QuickDoc without recording a service.</p>
</div>
<p>It is possible to stipulate via the field <em>Filter Service No. Lookup by</em> according to which criteria QuickDoc selects the suitable service for data which have already been captured. This function is meaningful when calling up QuickDoc without reference to the contract line, thus when QuickDoc is opened directly from the menu <em>Waste Producer Processes or Waste Disposal Processes</em> from the customer task site plan without branching onto the contract lines and from the standard order form.</p>
<p>If the customer rings up for example and orders the provision of a certain container, the case worker enters the customer, the equipment type <em>&quot;Submission&quot;</em> and the equipment type in QuickDoc where appropriate and receives a very strong selection of possible invoicing services. The system behaviour for waste management orders for which associated services can be established on the basis of an initially provided waste type is analogous to this.</p>
<p>Whether work takes place with this function is dependent on the design of the work flow. For dispatching codes with the document type &quot;<em>Contract&quot;</em> it is necessary to view the field <em>Filter Service No. Lookup by</em> and select the option <em>&quot;Blank&quot;</em> as the contract line already brings the service.</p>
<p>If the service is in principle input first of all when starting Quick Doc without reference to a contract, the option <em>&quot;Blank&quot;</em> should also be selected as the collection of the necessary data is otherwise rather troublesome.</p>
<p>The option <em>Material, Equipment</em> or <em>Both</em> only makes sense if these data are input first of all and the suitable service is to be established on the basis of this guideline.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>These options are however counter-productive if the service is in principle input first of all and further data are only entered afterwards. When validating waste management services, in QuickDoc (unlike in the normal contract and order form) there is in principle no automatic data transfer of the service into the fields <em>Material Code</em> and <em>EWC Code</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>For the option <em>&quot;Blank&quot;</em>, the user is however guided out of the field Material Code into the waste materials catalog which is attached to the service. When validating this number the linked EWC code is written into the corresponding QuickDoc field automatically.</p>
<p>If the field <em>Filter Service No. Lookup by</em> was however set to an option other than <em>leer</em>, this guidance of the user through QuickDoc is omitted. The user must then compile all data manually which are actually already connected with the service.</p>
<p>It is possible to stipulate via the field <em>Show Availability</em> whether a check of the availability of personnel, transport and equipment and the storage capacities takes place in the QuickDoc form at the same time. For this purpose the corresponding capacities of the individual resources in the system must be present.</p>
<p>The availabilities of transport groups, vehicles, personnel groups and also drivers is shown in the QuickDoc form behind the corresponding fields.</p>
<p>If several lines are marked in the contract lines overview of the customer base site plan, in order to create an order, the QuickDoc form is opened with e.g. 1/3 pages depending on how many contract lines have been marked. If an external document number is entered on page 1, then this document number is also transferred onto pages 2 and 3 if a corresponding tick has been placed in the field <em>Synchr. External Document No.</em> This applies analogously for the fields <em>Synchr. Ext. Bill. of Del. No., Synchronize Task Date , Synchr. Target Start Time.</em> and <em>Synchr. Finishing Time.</em></p>
<p>If a tick is placed in the field <em>Post Equipment</em>, the equipment is posted immediately on creation of the order with QuickDoc, meaning that the equipment does no longer have to be posted separately.</p>
<p>If the field <em>Service No.</em> is validated in the QuickDoc form, in an equipment service (work flow type = Equipment), the value is transferred from the field <em>Default Qty. Equip. Services</em> into the field <em>Quantity</em> of the QuickDoc form.</p>
<p>The field <em>Workflow Type</em> is important for the dispatching code if QuickDoc is called up from the customer task site plan without reference to a contract.</p>
<p>Dispatching codes which define suitable QuickDoc forms for this special application must have the document type &quot;<em>Contract&quot;</em> and have a tick in the field <em>Force Workflow</em>. Then the dispatching code forces a QuickDoc form which differs from the contract line.</p>
<br>
For clarification the three different types of dispatching code are characterised once again in brief below:
<h4 id="dispatching-code-document-type--contract">Dispatching Code Document Type = Contract</h4>
<p>Dispatching codes with the document type <em>Contract</em> which determine the appearance of the QuickDoc form from the contract line. This can be seen as a standard variant of the use of QuickDoc and thus of dispatching codes. The field <em>Workflowart</em> has</p>
<p><u>no</u></p>
<p>significance here. QuickDoc is started by the function</p>
<p><em>Create
Order.</em></p>
<h4 id="dispatching-code-document-type--order">Dispatching Code Document Type = Order</h4>
<p>Dispatching codes with the document type <em>Auftrag</em> which are addressed from the customer task site plan without reference to contract lines. Here a dispatching code with a suitable work flow type must be available for each of the various buttons in the header of the customer task site plan.</p>
<h4 id="dispatching-code-force-workflow">Dispatching code Force Workflow</h4>
<p>Dispatching codes of the document type <em>Contract</em> with a tick in the field <em>Force Workflow</em>. These dispatching codes can override the dispatching code in the contract line and force the fading in of &quot;its&quot; form in QuickDoc. Here too a unique dispatching code must be present for each variant of the order creation from the contract lines of the customer task site plan. This variant of the order generation and the work flow type must match (equipment order = Equipment Workflow type).</p>
<p>The work flow type is only the filtering criterion via which the correct dispatching code is assigned to the function button. The field <em>Workflow Type</em> of the dispatching card has the following options which are activated as filter criterion on calling up of the corresponding function:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defined</p>
</li>
<li><p>Default</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waste Mgt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Equipment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The way in which the content of this allocation is filled via the dispatching code is down to the user. It definitely makes sense to design content appropriate QuickDoc forms for the buttons</p>
<p><em>Disposal Order</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>equipment order</em></p>
<p>. Here the function designations prompt a content relationship for function and QuickDoc form.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is not such a content reference with regard to the functions <em>Default Order</em> and <em>Service Order.</em> With the help of this function it is possible to make additional QuickDoc forms available for the special order types.</p>
<p>The appearance of the QuickDoc form is</p>
<p><u>not</u></p>
<p>determined via the field <em>Workflowart</em> but exclusively through the settings made in the other fields of the dispatching code card.</p>
<p>With a value in the field <em>Minimum QuickDoc Height</em> (Min=0/Max=18480) a minimum height can be set for the QuickDoc screen. This means that if the QuickDoc screen is very small due to the settings in the dispatching code, it can be enlarged by a corresponding value in the field <em>Minimum QuickDoc Height</em>.</p>
<h3 id="dispatching-code---register-selection">Dispatching code - Register Selection</h3>
<p>The appearance of the QuickDoc form is determined via the register selection
of the dispatching card. The following options in the fields present can be set:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Disabled</th>
<th>A field with this option is not displayed in the QuickDoc form and can consequently neither be viewed nor processed.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Not Editable</td>
<td>A field which cannot be edited is displayed for information purposes but no aspect of its content can be changed by the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Active</td>
<td>An active field is displayed. Data can be entered, changed and deleted there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mandatory</td>
<td>Data must be present in a mandatory field. The data can originate from the underlying field and they can also be overwritten. A mandatory field must not, however, be empty. If a mandatory field is empty it will not be possible to complete the order logging with QuickDoc with the creation of an order.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The screen shot below shows a dispatching code which has been developed for the recording of equipment.</p>
<p>Only the fields <em>Equipment No</em>. and <em>Equipment Entry Type</em> have been declared as mandatory fields as a complete recording of equipment orders does not make sense without recording of these two fields.</p>
<p>The field <em>Equipment Application</em> was set to the option &quot;<em>Active&quot;</em> because an equipment application is frequently linked with an equipment order but it is not absolutely required. Data can thus be entered here. An order can however be created without an equipment application.</p>
<p>All other fields - up to the field <em>Service No</em>. - were deactivated.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>A service number must in principle be entered in each QuickDoc order. The field Leistungsnr. is always a mandatory field.</p>
</div>
<p>Obligatory fields which appear in each QuickDoc form as standard are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dispatching code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customer Task Site</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quantity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Task Date</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the service number, the fields are not mandatory fields which are checked on the part of the system, meaning checks do not take place to ascertain whether data have been entered in these fields.</p>
<p>If no fields have been declared as mandatory fields in the dispatching code, enwis only checks whether a customer and a service are present in the QuickDoc form.</p>
<p>The field <em>Service No.</em> is in any case a mandatory field, for which the register <em>Selection</em> of the dispatching code card only makes the selection between the options <em>Editable</em> and <em>Not Editable</em> available*.*</p>
<p>This means that there is only one possibility for selection here regarding the changeability of data. The option &quot;<em>Not Editable</em>&quot; (cannot be edited) is only meaningful in dispatching codes with the document type <em>Contract</em> in which the order line also has the service number which the user may no longer change where appropriate.</p>
<p>In dispatching codes with the document type <em>Order</em> by contrast, for the field <em>Service No.</em> it is necessary to select the option <em>Editable</em> as order recording with QuickDoc is otherwise impossible. As this field is empty without contract reference on calling up QuickDoc and an entry needs to be made by the user.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the fields of the register Selection
is that there are partial interactions between the settings of the individual fields. If the field <em>Waste Code</em> is deactivated for example, this results in a few fields on the right hand side only appearing dimmed and they can no longer be controlled.</p>
<p>The background to this is that for a QuickDoc form in which no internal Waste Code can be captured all additional indications with reference to the internal materials (e.g. EWC code, waste transfer note, storage location) are superfluous and thus no fields should be made available for this in the QuickDoc form.</p>
<h3 id="dispatching-code---register-display">Dispatching code - Register display</h3>
<p>In the register anzeige
(display) of the dispatching card form IDs can be consigned. The forms specified open in the QuickDoc form on Lookup from the fields Location, Bin, Waste Code and Equipment.</p>
<p>On consigning a corresponding Lookup-ID it is thus possible not to jump from the field <em>Lagerort</em> of the QuickDoc form into the standard location overview but into the dispatching overview for the individual locations. In this way it would be possible to assign a suitable location depending on the visible capacity of the various locations.</p>
<p>The register transfer
of the dispatching card is linked to the register selection
in terms of structure and partially in terms of functionality. In the register Auswahl
it is possible to specify which fields the user can view and in which fields he can make changes. In the register übertragung
it can or must also be specified to what extent these manually made changes are taken into consideration on data transfer from the contract into the order. The settings in both registers should therefore be matched to one another. In the register transfer
the option <em>Always</em> or <em>If not empty</em> should as a rule be allocated to active fields or mandatory fields.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>A customer orders the provision of an ARC50. The case worker does however only find a contract line for the provision of an ASM7 in the customer task site plan. In the QuickDoc form the field Equipment No. is set to the option &quot;Active&quot;. The case worker therefore changes the ARC50 predefined by the contract to ASM7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If, in the register <em>Tranfer</em>, the option <em>Never</em> was selected for the field Equipment No., this entry of the case worker is ignored by enwis. The change can be made in the QuickDoc form but the ARC50 consigned in the contract appears in the order created.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the option <em>Always</em> on the other hand the change is taken into account on the data predefined by the contract, meaning that the ASM7 is transferred into the order.</strong></p>
<p>Neither of the options is recommended as a standard setting. Instead all fields of the register Transfer
should be set to the option <em>If not empty.</em></p>
<p>The option <em>If not empty</em> means that changes made by the user are transferred, up to deletions. This means that if the user changes from the ARC50 predefined by the contract to ASM7, then this will be written into the order. If he should however remove the Equipment No. completely, this deletion is ignored and the data from the contract are accepted into the order.</p>
<p>The following options are available in the fields of the register card Transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always</p>
</li>
<li><p>If not empty</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These options define which data or which changes from the QuickDoc form are written into the order thus created. Here it is necessary to distinguish between various types of dispatching code.</p>
<p>Via the fields in the register transfer
it is possible to control the extent to which the user can intervene in the data transfer from the contract into the order. The aforementioned options have the following effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>All entries and changes made by the user in the QuickDoc form are transferred into the order. All deletions of data which are consigned in the contract are accepted into the order, meaning that if the user has deleted default data from the contract line in the QuickDoc form, these will be missing in the order.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>If not empty</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Deletions made by the user are not transferred. All other changes he has made are written through into the order. This is the recommended standard setting for the use of QuickDoc from the contract lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Never</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what the user enters in the QuickDoc form, the predefined data from the contract are accepted into the order unchanged. The user has no possibility of intervening in the data transfer from the contract into the order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>QuickDoc is then an extended copying function which only makes it possible to check the data to be copied from sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the register selection
it is specified which fields the user can view or process in the QuickDoc form or in which fields data must be present.</p>
<h3 id="dispatching-code---register-transfer">Dispatching code - Register Transfer</h3>
<p>Via the register transfer
it must additionally be specified what effect changes or deletions of data on the contract line made by the user may have.</p>
<p>For the option <em>Never</em> in the fields of the register transfet
the user has no possibility of changing predefined data from the contract sustainably. He can change the data in the QuickDoc form where necessary but these changes are not transferred to the order created. Instead enwis persistently goes back to the contract line during the order creation and ignores the changes in the QuickDoc form made by the user.</p>
<p>For the option <em>Always</em> on the other hand all changes made by the user are also transferred into the order. Order and contract may therefore differ in terms of content or the order may be incomplete because deletions of data made by the user are copied into the order.</p>
<p>The recommended standard setting is the option If not empty. For this option only changes to data are transferred, meaning when predefined data are replaced by other data in a field. Deletions are ignored on the other hand. If the user deletes data without entering new values, enwis goes back to the default data of the contract line.</p>
<p>This option is suitable for all fields in the register transfer
, to which the option <em>Active</em> or <em>Mandatory</em> was assigned in the register selection.</p>
<p>These fields are designated as workable in the register transfer
. Therefore changes made by the user should also be transferred into the order.</p>

<h1 id="order-line">Order line</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>In total there are over 50 different fields which can be selected on the order line. The most important ones are explained below.</p>
<p>The diversity of fields can easily make the order line unclear. The user will however as a rule only need a fraction of the fields and should therefore fade out the majority of them in order to be able to move quickly among the fields which are relevant.</p>
<h2 id="order-line-1">Order line</h2>
<p>The option field <em>Art</em> provides the three following options and also determines the behaviour of the field <em>No</em>.:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blank selection of a text</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service selection of a service</p>
</li>
<li><p>Item selection of an article</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard option in the field <em>Art</em> is &quot;Service&quot;. For the option &quot;Service&quot; the user is guided into the service overview, meaning the service catalog of the company, in the field <em>Nr</em>. and can select from the services defined here.</p>
<p>Numerous data consigned to the services are transferred automatically into the order line on input of the service number in the field <em>Nr</em>. The service descriptions are transferred into the fields <em>Description</em> or where appropriate <em>Description 2</em> of the order line.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Gen. Bus. Posting Group, VAT Bus. Posting Group</em>, <em>Gen. Prod. Posting Group</em> und <em>VAT Prod. Posting Group</em> are extracted from the data consigned to the customer or service by enwis as standard. The costs and proceeds from the operational area are entered in the accounts of the general ledger via these posting groups on invoicing the orders. These fields are normally filled automatically by the master data consigned for the customer or service.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If necessary these fields can be overwritten on the basis of the corresponding set up. This is however not advised. The case workers in the order logging should as a rule not concern themselves with the posting of proceeds on general ledger accounts. Posting groups should be maintained exclusively in the master data by the entitled persons.</p>
</div>
<p>The field <em>Posting Type</em> stipulates whether a customer or vendor business is involved; depending on the setting in this field the branching from the field <em>Buchung mit Nr</em>. occurs into the customer or vendor list.</p>
<p>The field <em>Post-with No</em>. is preallocated with the number of the customer entered in the order header. If various customers and possibly also vendors are to be activated in an order, this must be stipulated via the two fields <em>Posting Type</em> and <em>Post-with No</em>..</p>
<p>The customer or vendor task site are stipulated via the field <em>Task-at Code</em> of the order line.</p>
<p>The invoice recipient can be specified via the fields <em>Invoice-with No.</em> and <em>Inv. Sub-Adress Code</em> and this can be done completely regardless of who was entered in the line or order header as a customer or vendor.</p>
<p>As a rule the customer or vendor who is also captured in the field <em>Post-with No.</em> is also entered automatically into the field <em>Invoice-with No.</em> If for example a different invoice recipient is however consigned on the <strong>customer</strong> or <strong>vendor card</strong> (field <em>Bill-to Customer No.</em> on the register invoicing
) this different invoice recipient is written automatically into the field <em>Invoice-with No.</em> of the order line. The field <em>Invoice-with No</em>. on the order line can also be overwritten manually.</p>
<p>Via the field <em>Inv. Sub-Adress Code</em> an</p>
<p><u>invoice address</u></p>
<p>consigned to the customer or vendor which is different to their main address is allocated. This invoice address must have been consigned to the customer/vendor previously on the customer/vendor card.</p>
<p>The waste material or recyclable material is classified for waste management or transport orders via the fields <em>Waste Material Code</em> and <em>EWC Code</em>. These data are consigned in the master data of the service by many enwis customers so that both fields are automatically filled by these defaults.</p>
<p>The field <em>Waste Material Code</em> refers to the waste material catalog defined by the company itself which is the basis of the inventory valuation for example while the field <strong><em>EWC Code</em></strong> refers to the official EWC catalog.</p>
<p><strong><u>Note</u></strong></p>
<p>**The field designations <em>Waste Material Code</em> and EWC Code are not permanently present in the system. Instead they can be set up in enwis as follows:</p>
<p><em>enwis Services</em></p>
<p><em>Waste Material Administration Material Catalogs
Setup</em>**</p>
<p><strong>Here other designations can also be chosen for the fields <em>Globaler Int. Material Catalog</em> and <em>Globaler Ext. Material Catalog</em> depending on the wishes of the customer.</strong></p>
<p>Warehouse outflows and inflows or route business are depicted via the two fields <em>Waste Entry Type</em> and <em>Drop Shipment Type.</em></p>
<p>The field <em>Waste Entry Type</em> has the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stocking</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposal</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pos. Adjmt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Neg. Adjmt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transfer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drop Shipment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The entry types &quot;Stocking&quot; and &quot;Pos. Adjmt&quot; bring about a positive quantity movement in the warehouse, meaning that the storage quantity increases.</p>
<p>The entry types &quot;Disposal&quot; and &quot;Pos. Adjmt&quot; bring about a negative quantity movement in the warehouse, meaning that the storage quantity decreases.</p>
<p>The difference between storage (positive movement) and waste management (negative movement) on the one hand and inflow (also positive movement) and outflow (also negative movement) on the other is found in the fact that storage and waste management represent movement quantities with an external effect while inflow and outflow only have an internal effect.</p>
<p>The entry type &quot;Drop Shipment&quot; can be used to enter and sustain business by inventory which is not processed by the company's own storage locations but goes directly from one business partner to the other.</p>
<p>The entry type &quot;Transfer&quot; allows internally effective movements between two of the company's own storage locations to be posted.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Location Code</em> and <em>Bin Code</em> are of central importance for the warehouse administration. In enwis it is possible to set up any number of storage locations and - as a subdivision of them - any number of storage bins.</p>
<p>The available storage locations and bins can be accessed from the order line. If order lines are entered with storage location and/or bin, the waste and recyclable materials going in and out are entered directly on or from these storage locations or bins. This means that there is a control of the current inventories at any time.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Equipment No</em>. the equipment type (e.g. the 5 cbm skip) is stipulated. In addition a concrete individual item of equipment can be assigned to each order line and each equipment entry via the field <em>ID-Code</em> such as the 5 cbm skip with the identification number 4711 for example.</p>
<p>The option field <em>Equipment Entry Type</em> refers to equipment entries. It contains the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><blank>
</blank></li>
<li><p>Submission</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick-up</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exchange</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clearance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of content various types of equipment movements can be presented via the field:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a &quot;Submission&quot; means the transport of an item of equipment to the customer's site and set up there</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Submission*&quot;* the collection of an item of equipment from the customer</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Exchange*&quot;* refers to the exchange of an item of equipment for another one of the same type</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Clearance&quot; disposal of the waste contained in the item of equipment while the item of equipment remains at the customer's site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The settings made in the order line are transferred to the equipment entries belonging to the line or they can be overwritten there. This means that data for the equipment entry can be captured from the order line via the field <em>Equipment Entry Type</em> without having to change into these themselves.</p>
<p>The invoice quantity is in principle captured in the field <em>Quantity</em>.</p>
<p>The operational quantity is classified via the field <em>Service Type</em> and it is allocated the unit code consigned to the service. The content of the field <em>Service Type</em> comes from the master data of the corresponding service.</p>
<p>The corresponding &quot;to-field&quot; is filled by the service and an entry in the field <em>Operational Qty.</em> and a suitable line entry is applied. The line entries contain the data e.g. equipment quantity which are decisive for the entry of the operational processes.</p>
<p>Individually the various services have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>through the service &quot;Waste&quot; and an entry in the field *Operational</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qty. <em>the field</em> Qty. to Disposal* is filled and a corresponding waste management entry is applied.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The field <em>Qty. to Handle</em> is allocated through the service</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Equipment&quot; and an equipment entry is generated.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The field <em>Qty. to Drive</em> is filled by the service &quot;Transport&quot; in the same way and a transport entry is generated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The field <em>Qty. to Work</em> is allocated through the service &quot;personnel&quot; and a personnel entry is generated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The field <em>Operational Qty.</em> and the fields <em>Qty. to Disposal, Qty. to Handle, Qty. to Drive</em> and <em>Qty. to Work</em> are only input aids in order to be able to generate line entries with the operational service data without having to change from the line into the entries.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The data flow does in principle only run from the line to the entries and not in reverse. This means that inputs on the order line are transferred into the entry but changes made to the entry are not written back onto the line.</p>
</div>
<p>In the field <em>Unit Price</em> the service price per sales unit, meaning per tonne or cbm etc, is either input by the user or established automatically by the system. It is recommended that a standard service price is consigned to each service and that this is varied in line with other price forming factors such as e.g. price group of the customer.</p>
<p>Via a tick in the field <em>Price fixed</em> there is the possibility of fixing the input price in such a way that it can no longer be overwritten. But</p>
<p><u>no</u></p>
<p>price history develops when using this function.</p>
<p>The field <em>Quality Code</em> can be filled automatically from the master data of the service or it is maintained manually in the order line.</p>
<p>Quality codes can be defined completely free depending on the requirements of the company. In the area of waste management, additions of foreign materials, the purity of materials, the heating value and similar material properties can be shown.</p>
<p>From a functional point of view quality codes are an important, price forming criterion which is taken into consideration by enwis for pricing.</p>
<p>The field <em>Delivery Code</em> has an analogous functionality. Delivery codes as well can be defined completely freely in line with the requirements of the respective company. Transport distances or freight costs for example can be shown via the delivery codes. Delivery codes are also a price forming criterion.</p>
<p>Via the field <em>Job No.</em> the order line can be allocated to a particular waste management project. Projects are particular framework agreements in enwis - e.g. the complete waste management of a large building site</p>
<ul>
<li>for which special price agreements were made if necessary. Projects are therefore also a possible price forming criterion. Projects can also be used as a filtering criterion during invoice sorting for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The field <em>Order Code</em> provides the possibility of setting up internal sorting or filtering criteria by order codes via which batch processing e.g. the combine invoices can be controlled.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Concept No</em>. a concept can be allocated to the order line. In enwis concepts serve to distribute service quantities, costs and proceeds to the participants (e.g. Interseroh) for business in which several partners are involved.</p>
<p>Concept numbers captured in the order lines are written on the invoice entries so that it remains clear which concepts have triggered the distribution of costs and proceeds of a business transaction.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Commitments No</em>. business obligations and their gradual processing which are frequently encountered in the waste industry can be recorded (e.g. Interseroh, DSD).</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The sales department negotiates the annual removal of 10,000 tonnes of a particular waste material with a customer. This is the commitment. The material quantities do however result from a large number of small deliveries from other customers which can be recorded and entered via corresponding orders and lines.</strong></p>
<p>In the field <em>External Document No.</em> a default purchase order or order number or similar can be consigned by the customer. If such an external number has already been entered into the field of the same name in the entry register in the order form, the field <em>External Document No.</em> is then filled automatically in the lines of the order.</p>
<p>Each order line can however have its own document number allocated if necessary. This must always occur manually.</p>
<p>In the field <em>External Bill of Delivery No.</em> the number of an external weighbridge ticket can be captured for example if this needs to be additionally recorded for an external invoice number. There is a direct link from the order to the weighbridge via the option field <em>Weighbridge Dispatching</em>. Order lines which are set to the option &quot;Weigh&quot; in the field <em>Weighbridge Dispatching</em> are at present available to the weigh master as orders to be weighed.</p>
<p>As soon as an order line dispatched for the weighbridge is linked with a weighbridge ticket, the field <em>Weighbridge Dispatching</em> is set to the value &quot;weighed&quot; on the order form so that the order is already no longer present when the overview of the dispatched orders is viewed for the next time.</p>
<p>If a tick is made in the <strong><em>Weighbridge Setup</em></strong> in the register General
in the field <em>Auto-Transfer Weighbr. Result</em>, the weighing data are transferred into the order line connected to the weighbridge ticket automatically during the weighing process. No more work is involved here in the order processing.</p>
<p>The date of the service provision is captured in the field Task date. The dispatch date is set to the work date in the order header and the order lines by the system as standard. As a rule it must however be set to the dispatch date desired by the customer manually by the user on logging the order.</p>
<p>If a dispatch date was already set in the contract, this is accepted in the order if an order is created from the contract. The way in which enwis transfers the dispatch date from the contract to the order can be controlled in the <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong>, Register contract
via the field <em>Contract Task Date (Default)</em> .</p>
<p>It has the four options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transfer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create when blank</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blank</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the option &quot;Create&quot; the dispatch date is set to the actual work date of the system on order creation from the contract.</p>
<p>For the option &quot;Transfer&quot; a dispatch date fixed in the contract is copied into the order.</p>
<p>For the option &quot;Create when blank&quot; the current work date is taken if none was set in the contract.</p>
<p>For the option &quot;Blank&quot; no dispatch date is automatically issued on application of the order from the contract. The user must do this manually.</p>
<p>Via the two fields <em>Cost Center</em> and <em>Cost Object</em> each order line can be allocated to a cost center and/or cost object. The two fields are as a rule extracted from the master data consigned from the service.</p>
<p>The field <em>Invoice</em> is in principle set to &quot;Yes&quot; by enwis. If individual order lines are <em>not</em> invoiced for any reason, the tick placed in the field <em>Fakturieren</em> as standard must be removed manually. These lines are not taken into consideration in the combine invoice.</p>
<p>Via non billable order lines it is on the one hand possible to record services for customers which cannot or should not be invoiced (e.g. service errors) and on the other hand all internal company services.</p>
<p>By placing a tick in the field <em>Qty. Consolidation</em> those order lines should be marked which are in principle to be calculated with quantity compressed in the combine invoice. Quantity compressed invoice means that similar invoice quantities from various orders and order entries which have occurred for a customer in an invoicing period are brought together as an invoice entry.</p>
<p>The field can be set to &quot;Yes&quot; in the contract and thus transferred automatically to the order or only set to &quot;Yes&quot; in the order. Each order line to be invoiced can be controlled individually via the field <em>Qty. Consolidation.</em></p>
<p>In the field <em>On Hold</em> a maximum three digit code can be issued, e.g. the name abbreviation of the responsible case worker. The relevant order line for the invoices is blocked by any entry in this field.</p>
<p>The field <em>Comment</em> cannot be edited directly. If some comments were assigned via the link</p>
<p><em>action (Alt + F10) Line
line Comments</em></p>
<p>or <strong>Ctrl + S</strong> of the line, a tick appears in the field <em>Comment</em>.</p>
<p>Via the two fields <em>Contract No.</em> and <em>Contract Line No**</em>.** each order from which a contract was created is linked with this original form. These entries cannot be overridden manually by the user.</p>

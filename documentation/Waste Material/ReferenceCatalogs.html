<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>enwis has a comprehensive, integrated reference catalog system that allows users to execute automated and semi-automated searches of order addresses, task sites, and locations to find the valid waste materials, external waste, and services.</p>
<p>This system allows users to answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we have permission to dispose of a certain waste material from a task site?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have permission to deliver material to a certain waste management plant or disposal site (order address)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have permission to perform certain services for a customer?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have permission to source certain materials from a supplier?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have permission to store material at a certain location?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-positive-and-negative-catalogs">Setting Up Positive and Negative Catalogs</h2>
<p>Each vendor's order address, each customer's task site, and each location can be saved in both a positive catalog and a negative catalog.</p>
<p>Both catalogs can refer to services as well as waste materials and external waste numbers (though location catalogs only refer to physical materials, i.e. waste materials and numbers).</p>
<p>In essence, each positive and negative catalog actually represents three separate lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a catalog of waste materials</p>
</li>
<li><p>a catalog of external waste numbers (according to the AVV)</p>
</li>
<li><p>a catalog of services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can update the two catalogs from the <strong><em>vendor task site card</em></strong>, the <strong><em>customer task site card</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>location card</em></strong>. Each catalog lists the valid (positive catalog) and invalid (negative catalog) content.</p>
<p>In the vendor and customer task site cards, go to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Associated Information</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Addresses</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Positive
Catalog or Negative Catalog</span></em></p>
<p>to set up the catalogs.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image1.png" alt="134"></p>
<p>Setting up these reference catalogs enables the system can automatically check , for example, whether the selected waste material is valid for the waste management plant, the task site, and/or the location.</p>
<p>However, this check is only done if screening criteria have been saved. If not, the positive and negative catalog can still be used as an information system; however, the system cannot check automatically, though this is not always desirable anyway.</p>
<p>The screening criteria can be defined individually for each customer or vender task site and each location, and for each type of content therein. This can be set up, for example, in the <strong><em>customer task site card</em></strong> under the</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Waste Management</span></p>
<p>tab using the <em>Waste Comparison Type</em>, <em>Ext. Waste Comparison Type</em>, and <em>Service Comparison Type</em> fields.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image2.png" alt="134_2"></p>
<p>These three separate fields allow users to differentiate how the screening of waste materials, external waste, or services should be done, and it can be differently for each record. The following options are available for all three fields:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><empty></empty></th>
<th>No screening takes place, even if a positive and/or negative catalog has been saved.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive Catalog</td>
<td>Only the data in the positive catalog will be screened, even if a negative catalog has also been saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative Catalog</td>
<td>Only the data in the negative catalog will be screened, even if a positive catalog has also been saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both Catalogs</td>
<td>The data in both the positive and the negative catalogs saved in the system will be screened.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How these screenings look and what they can effect will be shown further below in more detail. The user has a broad range of options to influence this as well.</p>
<p>Let us begin with a simple case in which the a screening of the order with the relevant reference catalogs produces a kind of error message or informational message.</p>
<p>In this case, the system would screen whether a waste material or service is valid for a specific customer or vendor task site and produce an error message if that waste material or service</p>
<p><u>is not</u></p>
<p>found in the positive catalog of that customer or vendor task site.</p>
<p>When screening the negative catalog, the opposite situation triggers an error message, i.e. if the selected waste material or service</p>
<p><u>is</u></p>
<p>found in the negative catalog.</p>
<p>Users can define individually for each customer and vendor task site, each location, and each content type (waste material, external waste material, and service) whether the system should automatically screen the positive or negative catalog, depending, for example, on which method is less costly in terms of time or effort.</p>
<p>If only a few services are defined for the customer, the positive catalog is more efficient, whereas the negative catalog is better if all but a few services are offered to that customer.</p>
<p>Working with, or even screening, both a positive and a negative catalog for the same customer or vendor task site might seem impractical at first glance, but it can be very helpful in practice. It is quite possible that the positive catalog is not complete or is only updated cyclically, so that materials not on the list are in fact disposed or delivered there.</p>
<p>In comparison, an entry in the negative catalog makes it clear that certain materials absolutely cannot be disposed of for this customer or that certain services may be performed for the supplier under no circumstance.</p>
<p>Automatic screening between the movement information and the reference catalogs can be initiated for all relevant operating documents in the system. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sales quotes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contracts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Route plans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Routes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All waste management service lines related to the document will be screened. Catalog comparisons for routes therefore consider information that can be assigned to many different sales orders.</p>
<p>A comparison need not be restricted to the document users are currently working on; they can also be done for several documents at once.</p>
<p>In general, there are three different kinds of catalog comparison and each has different default settings and different consequences in the program for users:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explicit comparisons are initiated manually from a document.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatic comparisons are executed in the background when a status change or release is done.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inventory checks take place when posting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These three different kinds of catalog comparison are explained below.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-comparisons-from-a-document">Explicit Comparisons from a Document</h2>
<p>Users can manually initiate the explicit comparison of input information with the reference document saved in the system directly from any sales quote, contract, or sales order, and for each route plan and each route.</p>
<p>This comparison is launched in the order header by going to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Actions</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Function</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">compare
catalogs</span></em></p>
<p>A screen appears that filters the document lines in the current document to be compared. This filter can be modified by users so that multiple documents are screened at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image3.png" alt="137"></p>
<p>When users initiate the catalog comparison, the information in the document lines is compared to the master data saved in the positive and negative catalogs associated with the customer and vendor task sites and the locations according to the screening criteria specified there.</p>
<p>The result of the comparison might bring up different conflicts between the transaction information and the reference catalogs. If there are no conflicts, users receive a message telling them so.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image4.png" alt="137_2"></p>
<p>If there are one or more conflicts, however, these will be shown in a <strong><em>catalog comparison ledger entry form</em></strong> with all of the conflicting information. In the course of comparing the catalog(s), the system creates catalog comparison entries for each case where the document settings are not the same as the positive and negative catalogs. These entries record exactly which waste material or which service from which document conflicts with the positive or negative catalog and why.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image5.png" alt="137_3"></p>
<p>Any number of catalog comparisons can be made for each document at different times. The results screen shown only ever contains the results of the current comparison.</p>
<p>The catalog comparison entries shown as a result of the current comparison are not automatically saved in the database; rather, they serve first and foremost as information for the users.</p>
<p>The temporary catalog comparison entries generated through an explicit comparison can be saved (in a different context, these would be postings). The scope of users' influence on this is determined by the default setting in the <em>Save Man. Catalog Comparison</em> field under the</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Entries</span></p>
<p>tab in <strong><em>Waste Management Setup.</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="../../images/image6.png" alt="138"></p>
<p>The following options are available for this field:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Never</th>
<th>The catalog comparisons initiated manually will never be saved, neither by the system nor the users.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>The comparisons can only be saved when users do this manually by clicking on the</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Save</span></em></p>
<p>icon in the form.
Always   | The comparisons are always saved and users cannot prevent this.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Save</span></em></p>
<p>icon is only active when the default setting in <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong> is set to &quot;Optional&quot; and the current context allows this to happen.</p>
<p>All created and subsequently saved catalog comparison entries related to that catalog comparison are visible, filtered by the context and regardless of the type of card or document. The catalog comparison entries can be called up in the order header by going to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Associated Information</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Sales Order</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Catalog
Comparison Entries</span></em></p>
<p>or pressing <strong><em>Ctrl + F7</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Users can also call up a catalog comparison that is not filtered to a specific document by going to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">enwis
Services</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Waste Material</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">History</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Catalog
Comparison Entries</span></em></p>
<p>.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-comparisons-upon-status-change-and-release">Automatic Comparisons upon Status Change and Release</h2>
<p>The functions shown above with respect to manual, explicit comparisons initiated from a document have the benefit that users can employ them flexibly when needed and can react to them just as flexibly. As a reaction to an conflict message, users can change their selection in the sales order or ignore the message based on their own experience and understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>This might be considered a disadvantage, however, because the user is not forced to act. Users might also forget to execute the comparison.</p>
<p>Users always have the option of an explicit, manually initiated comparison (assuming they have the relevant access rights). In addition, there is an option for the system administrator or other authorized personnel to set up automatic catalog comparisons in the background, which operational users are unable to affect. All that is required is to change the settings in a few fields accordingly.</p>
<p>The automatic catalog comparison could take place when the status of a sales order changes and/or one is released. The settings for this are defined in the <em>Catalog Comparison on Status</em> and <em>Catalog Comparison on Release</em> fields under the</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Status</span></p>
<p>tab in <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image7.png" alt="139"></p>
<p>In this case, the catalog comparison is executed the same way as described for explicit comparisons. However, the results screen does not appear when the process is completed.</p>
<p>How the system should handle conflicts found during automatic comparison is defined in the <em>On Catalog Comparison Conflict</em> field under the</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Entries</span></p>
<p>tab in <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image8.png" alt="140"></p>
<p>The following options are available for this field:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Block Activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create Entry</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the automatic catalog comparison does not find any conflicts, users are unaware that a comparison even took place. The status of the sales order is changed or the sales order is released, as desired.</p>
<h3 id="block-activities-option">Block Activities Option</h3>
<p>When the <em>On Catalog Comparison Conflict</em> field is set to &quot;Block Activities&quot;, users may not change the status of, nor may they release, sales orders that contain conflicts until the conflicts are resolved.</p>
<p>If a conflict is discovered upon status change or release, then this activity will not be executed and an error message will appear.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image9.png" alt="140_2"></p>
<p>This conflict must be resolved before users can change the status of the sales order or release it. Users proceed to the sales order and manually execute an explicit comparison to determine what the conflict is and then to resolve it. Until the conflict is resolved, users cannot change the status of this sales order nor can they release it.</p>
<h3 id="create-entry-option">Create Entry Option</h3>
<p>When the <em>On Catalog Comparison Conflict</em> field is set to &quot;Create Entry&quot;, the program behaves quite differently.</p>
<p>In this case, automatic catalog conflict entries are created that record the conflicts found; however, the sales order processing is not interrupted and users can change its status or release it.</p>
<p>This setting is practical when catalog comparison conflicts are normally not a problem and it is enough to periodically review the content of the catalog comparison entries after the fact and to ensure the entries are not becoming more frequent.</p>
<p>It might also be the case that the operational business is a bulk business that should not be hindered by error messages that the executing employee may not even be in a position to evaluate or correct the content of. In this case, the catalog comparison entries could be reviewed regularly and promptly by a qualified specialist to process the content of released sales orders with catalog comparison conflicts.</p>
<p>The catalog comparison entries can be called up by going to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">enwis Services</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Waste
Material</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">History</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Catalog Comparison Entries</span></em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image10.png" alt="141"></p>
<h3 id="both-option">Both Option</h3>
<p>When the On Catalog Comparison Conflict field is set to &quot;Both&quot;, then catalog comparison entries will be created and the activities will be blocked.</p>
<p>In principle, this is merely a convenience function that allows users to localize the conflict without having to initiate an explicit comparison manually. All users have to do is call up the catalog from the document that the system has automatically assigned to it.</p>
<p>A special feature of the &quot;Both&quot; option is the add-on function that allows users to release a sales order in spite of existing conflicts in exceptional cases. Instead of resolving the existing conflict, users have the option of requesting permission from an administrator or authorized supervisor to release the sales order anyway. This option implements the logic described below.</p>
<p>When each sales order is created, it is given the check status &quot;Check Required&quot;. This does not mean that a check will or must be done in every case.</p>
<p>Whether a check is done depends on the criteria described above and the setting in the catalog comparison.</p>
<p>The check status makes it possible, however, to suppress the check required by this setting for an individual sales order. To do so, call up the eponymous function from the order header by going to</p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Actions</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Functions</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="smallcaps">Change
Check Status</span></em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image11.png" alt="142"></p>
<p>Access to this option can be granted through the assignment of permissions, so it is easy to limit such access to certain users.</p>
<p>If the check status of a sales order is set to &quot;No Check&quot;, the sales order can be released in spite of a conflict that would normally prevent this release. When users encounter a conflict that they cannot or do not want to resolve, they could have an administrator or supervisor with the appropriate authority decide whether the sales order may be released in spite of the existing conflict.</p>
<p>The check status is automatically reverted to &quot;Check Required&quot; after release of the sales order.</p>
<p>If the release of the sales order is reversed at a later point in time and the sales order is processed again, the check status might again have to be changed before the sales order can be released again. This prevents users from making sweeping changes to sales orders and then releasing them without review. This is the same reason why, when sales orders are copied, the check status of the copy is also set to &quot;Check Required&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-comparison-of-cost-posting">Automatic Comparison of Cost Posting</h2>
<p>A third possibility for automatic catalog comparison is to check the cost postings.</p>
<p>The <em>Match Stock Posting w. Catalog</em> field under the</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">stock</span></p>
<p>tab in <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong> sets whether stock postings should be compared with the positive and negative catalogs saved in the locations according to the criteria defined in the location card.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image12.png" alt="143"></p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Location</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bin</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <em>Match Stock Posting w. Catalog</em> field is set to &quot;Location&quot;, for example, this check will be executed for each individual stock post, i.e. including flushing and transfers that are posted through the ledger or through treatment orders.</p>
<p>If a catalog comparison conflict is found, the posting is interrupted.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image13.png" alt="143_2"></p>
<p>This error message cannot be overridden.</p>
<p>However, only posts representing incoming stock (posting types Receive/Ship, Recognition, Transfer) will be checked. The write-off of materials that are located in the wrong place should not be prevented.</p>
<p>Automatic catalog comparison is also suppressed for reversal and drop shipment posts.</p>

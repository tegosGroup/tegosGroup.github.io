<h1 id="charts-of-internal-waste-accounts-and-charts-of-external-waste-accounts">Charts of Internal Waste Accounts and Charts of External Waste Accounts</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>When applying internal waste materials and also for setting up EWC
materials an account is set up automatically by enwis for each material
type in which all quantity movements of the relevant material are
entered.</p>
<p>Ext. waste chart of accounts and waste chart of accounts are completely
congruent in terms of structure and function and they are thus described
jointly here. Any number of waste charts of accounts and ext. waste
charts of accounts can be set up. An individual plan name must be
allocated for each plan.</p>
<p>The ext.waste chart of accounts and the waste chart of accounts provide
a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the material movements
captured in enwis.</p>
<p>All entries, ledger entries and statistical functions which are also
available from the EWC card or the waste material card can be called via
the link <em>Related Information Account</em>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<p>There is the possibility of structuring the account plan via the field
<em>Account Type</em> which can be processed for every material both directly
from the account plan and also from the EWC card or the waste material
card. The function is thus completely analogous to that of the account
plan of the general ledger.</p>
<p>The field <em>Account Type</em> has the following options:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Posting</th>
<th>Material movements can only be entered on chart of account lines of the account type Posting. All EWC numbers and waste materials, the quantity movements of which are to be tracked via the chart of accounts must obtain the account type Konto.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Heading</td>
<td><p>Chart of account lines of the account type "Heading" <u>cannot</u> be posted. They only serve as structural elements to outline the chart of accounts and they are in bold font.</p>
<p>In order to set up headings in the chart of accounts, "superfluous" EWC numbers or waste materials must be defined and characterised as headings.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Total</td>
<td><p>Chart of account lines of the account type "Total" also <u>cannot</u> be posted.</p>
<p>If work is to take place with this sum function, those EWC numbers or waste materials, the values of which are to be added in the sum line, must be assigned to each chart of accounts line of the account type "Total" via the field _Zusammenzählung_. Both the following functions provide an analogous yet somewhat more comfortable possibility for totalling.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Begin-Total</td>
<td><p>Those chart of accounts lines which are to be added together can be surrounded with lines of the options "Begin-Total" and "End-Total" which refer to one another.</p>
<p>These options "Begin-Total" and "End-Total" are particularly meaningful if the complete chart of accounts is structured in such a way throughout and hierarchical sums, meaning sums from sums are to be formed where appropriate.</p>
<p>For this purpose it is sufficient to isolate the chart of accounts lines which are to be added together with "Begin Total and End Total”. Subsequently the function _Indent Chart of Account_ must be started. In this way the field _Totaling_ is filled automatically for one thing. This means enwis establishes automatically which accounts are to form a "End-Total" (amount to) and enters the relevant values into the field _otaling_. For another thing the accounts are inserted in the chart of accounts in line with their hierarchical classification which increases the readability of the chart of accounts.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>End-Total</td>
<td>See explanations for the option value "Begin-Total" (amount from).</td>
</tr>

</table>
<h2 id="quantities-and-movements">Quantities and movements</h2>
<p>The following quantities and movements are distinguished in the enwis
material charts of accounts:</p>
<p>The field <em>Stock Qty.</em> filters all waste ledger entries which do not
have the entry type &quot;Drop Shipment&quot;.</p>
<p>Entries of the &quot;Drop Shipment&quot; entry type do not make a record via their
own warehouse and instead show transports which are processed by the
company between third parties, as a rule customers and vendors. The
field <em>Stock Qty.</em> only excludes these transports between third parties
and is thus formed from the sum of all waste ledger entries of the
respective material.</p>
<p>It indicates the quantity of the respective material in the warehouse.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Stocking (Qty.)</em> and <em>Disposal (Qty)</em> capture the most
important <u>externally effective</u> material movements.</p>
<p>Entries of the type &quot;Stocking&quot; designate a material inflow from outside,
as a rule from a customer, from whom waste is typically accepted into
the store.</p>
<p>Conversely entries of the type &quot;Disposal&quot; (designate the externally
effective transfer of waste from the warehouse to e.g. a disposal site
or incinerator.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking it can be said that the inventory results from the
difference of storage and waste management.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Pos. Adjmt. (Qty.), Neg. Adjmt. (Qty), Pos. Adjmt. (Volume)</em>
and <em>Neg. Adjmt. (Volume</em>) only designate <u>internally effective</u>
quantity movements.</p>
<p>Such quantity movements are not captured via orders but via <strong><em>Waste
Journals</em></strong> or <strong><em>Waste Reclass. Journals</em></strong>. These changes in quantity
can result from inventory differences or weather influences for example.</p>
<p>Changes to the inventory are thus captured by the waste entry types
&quot;Pos. Adjmt&quot; and &quot;Neg. Adjmt&quot; (outflow) which do not have any external
effect and which instead serve the internal stock correction.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Transport Pos. Adjmt. (Qty.)</em> and <em>Transport Neg. Adjmt.
(Qty.)</em> are by contrast used to show material movements which do not
affect the warehouse at all. Only so-called route businesses are used
here in which the waste is supplied directly from the customer to the
vendor without being stored on their own sites in the interim.</p>
<p>The route types &quot;Pos. Adjmt&quot; and &quot;Neg. Adjmt.&quot; show both sides of the
route business, thus the mainly customer collection of waste and the
mainly vendor transfer to a disposal site or incinerator.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Refusal (Qty), Partial Refusal (Qty.), Redirection (Qyt.)</em>
and <em>Partial Redirection (Qty.)</em> refer to the various types of refusal
ledger entries. Refusal ledger entries are to be generated if hazardous
waste cannot be accepted into the warehouse for capacity reasons for
example.</p>
<p>This necessary refusal to accept materials must be recorded for legal
reasons connected to waste disposal. In enwis the recording occurs in
the form of refusal ledger entries.</p>

<h1 id="equipment-ledger-entries-and-rental-value-entries">Equipment ledger entries and rental value entries</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>Equipment ledger entries and rental value entries where appropriate develop either from an equipment entry which was applied to an order line or from an equipment journal line.</p>
<p>On posting the equipment entry (on clearance of the order) or the posting of the journal line, two types of entry develop, namely an equipment ledger entry and a rental value entry.</p>
<p>The equipment ledger entry represents the actual quantity movement of the equipment (the inventory). The rental value entry is the basis for the invoicing of a rental (the invoice).</p>
<p>Inventory movements and invoices can be separated clearly through the two different entries. This is exactly what occurs in practice: The current equipment inventory with the customer and the invoices of the equipment rental are virtually never congruent and they run separately to one another according to temporal and content logic.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p>Lets us assume we post a submission on 09.01 with the invoice method MONAT. Within the invoice method it is stipulated that a rent is to be calculated once per month for a month. This means that the next rental calculation would be possible on 31.01 for the first time. Let us look at the most important fields of both entry tables following posting.</p>
<h2 id="betriebsmittelposten-equipment-ledger-entry">Betriebsmittelposten (equipment ledger entry)</h2>
<p>First of all the equipment ledger entries which present the physical inventory:</p>
<p>Let us look at the most important fields of the open equipment inventories in more detail: (not all fields are displayed in the image).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Entry Type:</em> Here a distinction is made between Submission, Pick-up, Exchange and Clearance in the operational area</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Document No</em>.: If an equipment ledger entry is generated via an order, the order number will be here or otherwise the document number which is entered manually via the journal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Start Date:</em> Date on which the process actually takes place (e.g. the provision). The start date can be independent of the posting date</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Source Type, Source No. and Source Site Code</em>: These fields correspond to the fields <em>Posting type (sale/purchase), Post-with No.</em> and <em>Customer Task Site</em> of the order line or the fields of the same name in the equipment journal. From there they are transferred into the equipment ledger entries</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Equipment No.:</em> Container / receptacle which is physically located on site</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rental-value-entries">Rental value entries</h2>
<p>Let us now look at the table rental value entries (not all fields are shown in the image).</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Before the decisive fields for calculation of the rental are investigated, here is a short explanation on the terminology. The fields Source Type, Source No. und Source Site Code are also present in the rental value entries table. Logically they have a slightly different meaning adapted to the differing function of both tables:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Source Type:</em> Is filled analogously to the equipment ledger entry table</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Source Site Code</em>: Is filled analogously to the equipment ledger entry table</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Source No.:</em> Customer from the field Invoice-with No.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Post.-with No.:</em> Customer from the field Post-with No. from the equipment ledger entry</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisive fields for the calculation of the invoice period are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Invoice Method Code:</em> This is established from the rental invoice matrix and written on the entries. This can be input directly into the equipment entry or the journal as preferred. It then has a higher priority than the invoice method which is consigned in the rental invoice matrix</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Invoice Status:</em> The value &quot;Billable&quot; must be set in this field so that the rental value entry is taken into consideration in the rental invoice. This is always the case if the tick is placed in the field Billable in the underlying invoice method</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Next Invoice From)**</em>:** On the basis of the parameters consigned in the invoice method, the next, earliest possible invoice deadline is calculated and entered here. In our example the equipment was placed on 09.01.2013. The rent is to be calculated once a month. This means that the next invoicing date is 31.01.2013</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Invoice calculated until:</em> If a completed order or a posted invoice has occurred for this ledger entry through the rental invoice, the date up to which the rental has already been calculated is entered here. In our example we would have a completed order with an invoicing period of 09.01.2013 - 31.01.2013 through the rental statement. The 31.01.2013 would then be entered in the field <em>Invoice calculated until</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Invoice until*:* If the aforementioned order is fully invoiced (i.e. there is an invoice posted for this entry), this field is filled with the value from the field <em>Invoice calculated until</em>. So here we have 31.01.2013</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changing-of-a-rental-value-entry-through-the-rental-invoice">Changing of a rental value entry through the rental invoice</h2>
<p>In order to make the changes clearer we only look at the four fields named above. The starting point was the entered provision of 09.01.2013 and the next possible invoicing date 31.01.2013 (not all fields are shown in the image).</p>
<p>The rental invoice is started via the link</p>
<p><em>enwis invoicing combine invoicing rental
Invoice</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The fields <em>Invoice Date, Posting Date</em> and <em>Task Date</em> on the register Options
of the rental calculation are particularly important for the creation of the rental invoices - both with the value 31.01 in the example.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Invoice Date:</em> Date on which the rental invoice is to be started. The current date is e.g. 28.01.2013, the next rent may only be calculated from 31.01.2013 in our example. If 31.01.2013 is posted in the field Abrechnungsdatum, the rental can be calculated in advance</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Posting Date</em>: Date on which the rental invoice is to be entered (general ledger entry date)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Task Date:</em> A dispatching date for a rental period does not initially appear particularly meaningful. Let us however assume that our customer wishes to have his waste management and rental services shown on</p>
<p><u>one invoice</u></p>
<p>per month. He thus generates completed orders for his waste management services. These all have a dispatching date, namely the day on which the service was performed. In addition he creates a completed order for his rentals. In normal combine invoicing the customer enters a limitation for the month of January (dispatching date 01.01.2013 - 31.01.2013). If the rental order did not have a notional dispatching date, all the rental order lines would not be captured by this filter. This means that the input of a notional dispatching date (usually the end of the month) can definitely be meaningful for the purposes of limitation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to select whether the rental invoice completed orders or invoices which have not been posted is generated by customer/vendor in their invoice layout in the field <em>Invoice Transfer into</em> on the register</p>

<p>The following completed order has been generated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This order is now processed completely up to the posted invoice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Following creation of the posted invoice the rental value entry looks as follows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Three changes in the rental value entries have resulted from the creation of the posted invoice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The field <em>Invoice Status</em> was moved from &quot;Billable&quot; to &quot;Partly Invoiced&quot; as the equipment was not yet collected and thus will be invoiced at least once more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The field <em>Invoice until</em> was filled with the value from the field <em>Invoice calculated until</em> as the rental is no longer just calculated but already posted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The field <em>Next Invoice from</em> was newly calculated on the basis of the parameters consigned in the invoice method (monthly calculation, last calculation up to 31.01.2013, thus next invoice from 28.02.2013).</p>

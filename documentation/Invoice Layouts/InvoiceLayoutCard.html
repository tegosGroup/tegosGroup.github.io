<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The invoice layouts are the central switch point for the compilation, creation and design of the combine invoices and also a few related operations. The control mechanisms made available via the invoice layout mainly involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creation and sorting of the combine invoice/rental invoice</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type of sorting information for combine invoice/rental invoice</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type, scope and sequence of additional texts for combine invoice/rental invoice</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type, scope and sequence of additional texts for quantity consolidation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Special texts before and following invoices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-register">General register</h2>
<p>The graphic layout of the invoice can be specified via the field <em>Report Type Code.</em> The data flow of the combine invoice is controlled via the invoice layout as the sorting of the individual invoice entries, the addition of the texts before and after, page breaks,...</p>
<p>The actual graphic layout of the invoices or credit memos to be created must however be determined with a special report and it can where appropriate be designed individually for individual customers / customer groups. The reports developed for this purpose can be selected via the field <em>Berichtsartencode</em>.</p>
<p>Report codes can be defined in the menu</p>
<p><em>enwis
invoicing
Administration
Report Selections
Report Types
or Report
Selections</em></p>
<p>. For this purpose the use must be determined. The following must be set up for the combine invoices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Invoice or credit memo</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report code for the individual customers / customer groups</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report ID</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The set up for the creation of invoices which have not been posted could look as follows:</p>
<p>The fields <em>Customer Posting Group</em> und <em>Vendor Posting Group</em> are standard functions of MSBusiness Central integrated into enwis. The current accounting is shown via these posting groups. This means that the receivables accounts, the cash discount accounts, the billing and compensation accounts, the interest and charge accounts are consigned in a differentiated way for different groups of customers and vendors.</p>
<p>A posting group must be allocated to each customer or vendor via the customer or vendor card so that invoices and credit memos can be entered correctly.</p>
<p>A customer and vendor posting group can also be consigned in the invoice layout. The posting groups from the invoice layout established for the customer or vendor override the values consigned in the customer or vendor card.</p>
<p>Counting forms can be allocated to customers and vendors. These are used in order to determine how an invoice is paid (e.g. transfer, cash,..). The payment forms can be consigned on the customer or vendor card on the register payments
.</p>
<p>A payment form can also be consigned in the invoice layout. The payment form from the invoice layout established for the customer or vendor overrides the value consigned in the customer or vendor card.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Rental Invoice Layout Code</em> an invoice layout for the rental invoice can be consigned. This invoice layout is transferred into the rental value entry on order clearance and taken into account within the framework of the rental invoice.</p>
<p>It is possible to consign the sorting information for the combine invoice and rental invoice in the specifications Layout Code. This specifications layout can be allocated to the &quot;general&quot; invoice layouts. The advantage is that the sorting information only needs to be consigned once and assigned to the corresponding invoice layouts.</p>
<p>If the field <em>Add. Texts from Spec. Layout</em> has</p>
<p><u>no</u></p>
<p>tick, the additional texts from the specifications layout are taken into account in the combine invoice, rental invoice and quantity consolidation.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Prefix Info Sub-Sorting</em> a prefix (e.g. dash) can be defined which is then placed in front of an info line of the sub sorting used as a header.</p>
<h2 id="register-combine-invoice">Register Combine Invoice</h2>
<p>In the option field <em>New Invoice per</em> on the invoice layout card a selection must be made between the options &quot;Business-with No.&quot; and &quot;Invoice-with No.&quot;. Both options are identical to the fields of the same name on the order line via which the invoice recipient is defined. This is usually the service recipient, for which the order was created and under which number the entry was made. As a rule both fields therefore have the same content.</p>
<p>Another customer can be declared as invoice recipient on the order line in the field <em>Invoice-with No.</em> In this case the option invoice layout <em>New Invoice per</em> <em>= Invoice-with No</em> would sensibly be selected for the invoice layout.</p>
<p>If the field <em>New Invoice per</em> has the option <em>Invoice-with No.</em> selected, there is the possibility of additionally placing a tick in the field <em>Sort. by Business-with No..</em> The orders on the combine invoices are then sorted automatically following the posting with number.</p>
<p>The sorting of the combine invoices is controlled in the option fields <em>Invoice Sorting by (1) – (6)</em>. Here the criterion must be indicated according to which the combine invoice is to compile the individual entries.</p>
<p>If the option &quot;Blank&quot; is selected, the order entries are arranged in the order in which they are located in the system, meaning in the order of the order entry, thus sorted according to order numbers and line numbers.</p>
<p>One thing which is significantly more useful and in line with the actual function of the invoice layout is however one of the numerous options offered for selection for sensible compilation of the invoice entries in terms of content.</p>
<p>Only the most important of these are named here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Task site</p>
</li>
<li><p>Order Type Code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quality Code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In total there are more than 20 different functions available in the field <em>Invoice Sorting by</em>.</p>
<p>In the option fields <em>Break on Sort Change (1) – (6)</em> it is determined how enwis should behave if it meets a new sorting criterion. An example of a change of type would be the change from the Rathausstraße customer task site to the Hauptstraße customer task site if the customer task sites were specified as a criterion for the invoice sorting.</p>
<p>If the field <em>Info on Sort Change (1) – (6)</em> also has the option &quot;Full Text&quot; selected, the complete address is added to the customer task sites.</p>
<p>For the option &quot;Full Text&quot; a multi-line information text is issued. This option is not available for all sorting criteria. If it is not available, it is replaced automatically by the option &quot;Info Line&quot;. The option &quot;Full Text&quot; is available for the following sorting criteria and it has the effects described below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Sorting criterion</strong></th>
<th><strong>Issue</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bal. Acc. No.</td>
<td>Complete address of the customer/vendor of the counter entry</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bal. Acc. Site</td>
<td>Complete address of the customer/vendor task site of the counter entry</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>task site</td>
<td>Complete address of the customer/vendor task site</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service/Quality</td>
<td>Description of a service quality specially applied for this combination from service and quality where appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tour</td>
<td>Description of the tour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tour plan</td>
<td>Description of the tour plan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the field <em>Info on Sort Change (1) – (6)</em> has the option &quot;Info Line&quot; selected, the system inserts an empty line and an information line. The sorting criterion is written into the info line in our example of the code of the customer task site. All associated invoice entries follow under these info lines.</p>
<p>If the field <em>Break on Sort Change</em> has the option &quot;New Invoice&quot; set, a new invoice or credit memo is applied for each type change.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The selection of the combination Invoice Sorting by = Document No. and <em>Break on Sort Change</em> = New Invoice can also be created within the combine invoice single invoices or credit memos. In contrast to the direct invoice of individual documents, the rules for automatic insertion of additional information which are consigned in the invoice layout code are however accessed so that the invoice can be formed more transparently, more meaningfully and more flexibly.</p>
</div>
<p>The option &quot;Pagebreak&quot; in the field <em>Break on Sort Change</em> triggers a page break for each change of the sorting criterion. A prerequisite for this option is that a sorting criterion must be determined. This option is only valid if the field <em>Zäsur bei Sortenwechsel</em> does not have the option &quot;New Invoice&quot; as a new document is generated in this case on changing the sorting criterion which implies the start of a new printed page.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The field <em>Break on Sort Change</em> (1) – (6) makes sorting into six downstream levels possible. This means that after sorting according to e.g. customer task sites has taken place, the service and invoice entries which are thus assigned to a customer task site can then once again be sorted according to all criteria which are available on the first level (e.g: Document No., Contract No., Job No.) etc.
Via the field <em>Info on Sort Change</em> it is also possible to search for the options Infozeile or Volltext once again, through which the corresponding texts are inserted for a type change of the second or third order... as well. It is however not possible to trigger a new invoice or a page break through the type change on these downstream sorting levels.**</p>
</div>
<h2 id="register-rental-invoice">Register Rental Invoice</h2>
<p>In the register
<em>rental Invoice</em></p>
<p>of the invoice layout card it is possible to make settings for the rental invoice by combine invoice:</p>
<p>In the field <em>Report Type Rental Invoice</em> a special code for the rental invoice can be consigned. This means that a report can be selected via this field which defines the graphic design of the invoice creation for this customer.</p>
<p>In contrast to the settings in the register Combine Invoice
of the invoice layout card sortings of the first and second order can be made for the rental invoice. This sorting is defined via the option fields <em>On Rental Inv. Sort Change</em> and <em>Rental Invoice Sub-Sorting by</em>. The following criteria can be selected:</p>
<ul>
<li><blank>
</blank></li>
<li><p>Customer Task Site</p>
</li>
<li><p>Order Type Code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Document No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contract No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Job. No.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ex. Doc. No</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rental No.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Via the field <em>On Rental Inv. Sort. Change</em> it is possible to set whether a new invoice is to be created or an info line inserted for a type change. A tick in the field <em>Info. Line on R. Inv. Sub-Sort.</em> ensures that the second sorting level is generated on a type change. This means that the rental invoice can be controlled through the invoice layout completely analogous to the &quot;normal&quot; order statement even if a somewhat limited number of options is offered in comparison.</p>
<p>Unlike the &quot;normal&quot; invoice layout the rental time period can also be issued in an additional info line in the rental invoice. A tick must be placed in the field <em>Show Rental Period</em> for this purpose.</p>
<p>The field <em>Invoice Transfer into</em> can be used to control whether completed order lines _(_Invoice Transfer into = completed orders) or direct unposted invoices (Invoice Transfer into = unposted invoices) are to be created by the combine invoice first of all.</p>
<p>Unlike in the &quot;normal&quot; order creation and statement there are first of all no direct rental relevant order lines in enwis. In the rental transaction orders only trigger the provision, exchange, emptying and collection of equipment. The number and type of equipment, a service type, the data of the provision or collection and the customer are all located in rental orders or in the equipment entries of the order lines. Possible price forming criteria may be present but a direct price for the rental invoice does not have to be taken from the order. Significant information for the rental price calculation is missing which enwis takes from the order lines for the invoicing of other orders. The rental price calculation always and exclusively occurs via the rental invoice matrix. The invoice method and the rental price are calculated from this matrix and via the codes consigned there for the invoice sequence for the rental invoice. This information can be written in either completed order lines or invoices which have not been posted.</p>
<h2 id="register-qty-consolidation">Register Qty. Consolidation</h2>
<p>Via the field Automat. Textbaustein it is possible to insert the standard text component of this service into the invoice in addition to the service. Text components can be assigned to a service in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a text component is assigned to the relevant service via the service card and the field <em>Automatic Ext. Texts</em> is ticked on the service card</p>
</li>
<li><p>on the customer card a customer specific designation is allocated to the service via the link</p>
<p><em>Navigate Service
Description</em></p>
<p>as an automatic text component. Here a tick must also be inserted into the field <em>Automatic Ext. Texts</em> if the consigned service description is to appear in invoices and credit memos by combine invoice. In the case of conflict the customer specific service description has priority in front of the general standard text component which is consigned on the service card.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="register-display">Register Display</h2>
<p>In the <em>Feld Grad. Price Splitting</em> the selection exists between the options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi line</p>
</li>
<li><p>Single line</p>
</li>
<li><p>Single line plus info</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the following graduation with splitting is agreed with a customer for the pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>0 – 3 t = 15-, €</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 – 6 t = 12-, €</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>6 t = 10-, €</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the resultant invoice entry can be presented in one line with it remaining unclear to the invoice recipient how the price for e.g. 12 t is made up in concrete terms and the price per t is reduced in stages in this example from 15-,€ to 10-,€.</p>
<p>If this is to be presented clearly for the customer, the multiple line presentation must be selected.</p>
<p>For this multi-line presentation the billable service is however split up over several lines while the warehouse relevant waste management quantity remains linked to the first line. This presents a severe handicap for the cost accounting viewing of the order.</p>
<p>If work with graduated volumes is to take place in the pricing policy and the orders are subsequently to be analysed by the controlling, the option &quot;single line plus info&quot; must be chosen. Here the complete invoice service remains on the first line on which the average price calculated is declared. In addition further text lines are generated under this service line which explain in the form of an informative text how the average price indicated has come about. The customer thus receives all the information about the pricing in detail without the invoice service being split up. The assignment of invoice and service quantity is thus possible without any difficulty.</p>
<p>In the field <em>Sub-Total Type</em> it is possible to choose between the options &quot;Blank&quot;<em>, &quot;Amount&quot;, &quot;Quantity&quot; and &quot;Both&quot;)</em>. Subtotals can be formed for each primary sorting criterion. This means that if the criterion &quot;Customer task site&quot; is selected in the field <em>Invoice Sorting by</em> for example and a subtotal was determined, a subtotal is formed for each customer task site through the invoice layout and the report used for the combine invoice.</p>
<p>On issue of the subtotals in the report a line with a descriptive text and the corresponding subtotal is generated in the field <em>Quantity and/or Amount.</em></p>
<p>It is possible that a subtotal for quantities is not printed although this was set by the user. Subtotals for quantities are only meaningful and calculated correctly if sorting occurs according to quantity relevant criteria and the unit code is not changed. Otherwise subtotals with a misleading content would be issued.</p>
<p>enwis therefore checks whether the main sorting criterion is a service, an article or a waste material and whether all quantities refer to the same unit code. If this is not the case, no subtotal for the quantity is issued.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>As subtotals are established dynamically, this can only occur via reports which support this functionality. In enwis there are the following standard reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>5030453 Waste Mgt. - Sales Invoice</li>
<li>5030454 Waste Mgt. - Sales Cr. Memo</li>
<li>5030475 Proforma Sales Invoice</li>
<li>5030476 Proforma Sales Credit Memo
Individual reports must be adapted accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the field <em>Invoice Copies</em> it is possible to specify how many invoice copies are to be created on printing the invoice.</p>
<p>The <em>Exclude from Tour Multi-Report</em> (do not print multi-tour report) does strictly speaking have nothing to do with the invoice layout. Multi-reports do in principle work on an order lines basis, meaning that documents can be created from the many lines of an order by using them. Here a new page is applied for each line and the customer indicated on the line is entered in the header of each page. The multi-report function enables the information in the order header to be ignored in a targeted way when creating documents and to be replaced by information from the line.</p>
<p>The tour logic provides the possibility of printing order confirmations, shipment slips and other papers of all associated order lines across different orders. The tour logic made a batch functionality multi-report available: All reports for the whole tour are issued for all associated orders via a print command.</p>
<p>Within the framework of this agreement there are nevertheless many customers for whom no reports are to be printed out although they do definitely have documents sent to them in different contexts. In order to enable this, the field do not print multi-report is available on the invoice layout card which can be ticked individually for each customer.</p>

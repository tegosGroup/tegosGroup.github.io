<h1 id="invoicing-overview">Invoicing Overview</h1>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>Users of enwis have the option of invoicing sales orders directly or through batch processing. Below is an overview of the invoicing process.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-number-series">Setting Up a Number Series</h2>
<p>Before invoicing, it is necessary to save all the necessary number series (e.g. for unposted and posted invoices) in the Document No. Series Matrix. To find the document number series matrix, go to enwis</p>
<p><em>Invoicing Administration</em></p>
<p><em>Setup</em></p>
<p>Document No.
Series Matrix</p>
<h2 id="invoice-layout">Invoice Layout</h2>
<p>Invoice layouts are the central interface for compiling, creating and designing combine invoices and for some of the related operations. The control mechanisms available through the invoice layout mainly affect the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creation and sorting of combine invoices and rental invoices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type of sorting information for combine invoices and rental invoices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type, scope and order of additional texts for combine invoices and rental invoices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type, scope and order of additional texts for quantity consolidation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Special pre-texts and post-texts for invoices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There must be an invoice layout code in the lines of completed orders so that they can be invoiced. Without an invoice layout code, combine invoicing is</p>
<p><u>not</u></p>
<p>possible.</p>
<h2 id="release-and-completed-orders">Release and Completed Orders</h2>
<p>Service orders are converted into completed orders by releasing them. To find completed orders, go to</p>
<p><em>Invoicing</em></p>
<p><em>Completed Orders</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Completed orders offer uses the opportunity to visually inspect and print out sales orders or invoice them directly before the combine invoicing step.</p>
<p>Users can convert completed orders back into sales orders that can be edited by using</p>
<p><em>Withdraw Release</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>Withdraw Release and Show</em></p>
<p>functions, provided that there are no unposted documents related to these completed orders. After undoing the release, the sales orders are again available for processing in the operational order menus</p>
<p><em>Waste Producer Processes</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>Waste disposal Processes.</em></p>
<p>Every completed order line with its <em>Invoice</em> box checked will be invoiced. If the <em>Invoice</em> box is not checked, this order line will</p>
<p><u>not</u></p>
<p>be included in the combine invoicing process.</p>
<p>During combine invoicing, completed orders will be transferred into sales invoices, sales credit notes, purchasing invoices and purchasing credit notes.</p>
<p>The system decides automatically whether to create an invoice or a credit note depending on whether the total amount for services to be invoiced to a customer or vendor is positive or negative.</p>
<p>Completed orders can be deleted after posting an invoice or credit note. This will depend on the setting of the <em>Del. Compl. Orders on Posting</em> field under the General
tab in</p>
<p><em>Invoice Setup</em></p>
<p>. If this box is checked, the completed orders will be deleted after posting the invoice or credit note; otherwise, they will remain in enwis.</p>
<h2 id="combine-invoicing">Combine Invoicing</h2>
<p>To find batch processing for combine invoices, go to enwis</p>
<p><em>Invoicing</em></p>
<p><em>Combine
Invoicing</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The posting and document date for the invoices and credit notes can be set under the Options
tab.</p>
<p>All available fields for the waste management line can be filtered under the Completed Orders
tab.</p>
<p>In the example above, all completed orders for customers where the invoice layout was set to STANDARD and that were created in the period between 10/1/2013 and 10/31/2013 were invoiced and made ready for combine invoicing.</p>
<p>Users can also add combine invoicing filters using</p>
<p><em>Add filter</em></p>
<p>under the Completed Orders
tab.</p>
<h2 id="unposted-invoices-and-credit-notes">Unposted Invoices and Credit Notes</h2>
<p>The generated combine invoices and credit notes are available as unposted documents in Invoicing
.</p>
<p>All of the pricing and editing logic within enwis is available in the unposted documents, so users can continue to edit these invoices and credit notes. For example, they can still change or delete services.</p>
<p>Individual lines in an unposted combine invoice or credit note can be deleted, in which case they are again available in the completed orders for the next combine invoice.</p>
<p>If an unposted combine document is completely deleted, the corresponding completed orders will again be released for invoicing. This release can be undone within the completed orders, so that the sales orders are again available in the</p>
<p><em>Waste Producer
Processes</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>Waste disposal
Processes</em></p>
<p>menus.</p>
<h2 id="posted-invoices-and-credit-notes">Posted Invoices and Credit Notes</h2>
<p>Invoices and credit notes have to be archived after posting; otherwise, they cannot be reversed at a later time. To make sure this happens, check the <em>Archive Invoice</em> and <em>Archive Credit Note</em> boxes under the Archive
tab in <strong>Waste Management Setup</strong>.</p>
<p>enwis offers all of the standard reversal and clearance options of Business Central for invoicing in respect to values. When a sales or purchasing credit note is posted, it can be offset in a posted standard invoice.</p>
<p>In addition, customer and vendor ledger entries can be flagged with an &quot;Applies-to ID&quot; and the credit note will automatically be applied to these entries when it is posted.</p>
<p>The posted invoices and credit notes shown in the</p>
<p><em>Invoicing</em></p>
<p>menu are the final documents that were posted directly from the unposted combine documents to the default general ledger. Only posted documents created by enwis will be visible here.</p>

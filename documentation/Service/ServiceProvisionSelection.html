<h1 id="service-provision-selection">Service Provision Selection</h1>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>enwis offers the option of setting up a service provision matrix that lists which business partners can provide which services and which business partners your company can provide which services to.</p>
<p>The selection parameters include the service group, the service, the region, and the starting date. Using this logic, users can select a vendor with its task site, a customer with its task site, a vehicle, and if necessary, a different vendor or customer for the invoices. This selection allows users to modify either the posting (e.g. <em>Post-with No.</em> field in the document line) or the balance account (e.g. <em>Bal. Acc. Post-with No.</em> field in the document line).</p>
<h2 id="default-settings">Default Settings</h2>
<p>The service provision matrix can be addressed manually from the creator's sales quotes, contracts, and sales orders, and automatically via <strong><em>QuickDoc</em></strong>, as well as by calling up programming functions such as status change and release code units.</p>
<p>Before working with the service provision matrix, it is necessary to put certain default settings in place in <strong><em>Dispatching Setup</em></strong> under the Service
tab.</p>
<p>The selection of service providers can be associated with a region code. The <em>Region Type Service Provision</em> field determines which type of region code is involved.</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dispatching Group</p>
</li>
<li><p>Area</p>
</li>
<li><p>Territory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Postal Code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Local Auth. Key</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The region type must be selected before anything can be entered into the service provision matrix and once there are lines in the service provision matrix, the region type can no longer be changed.</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>Service Provision Scope</em> field defines whether the service provision matrix will mainly be used to determine the source of a service performed for the company (normally from a vendor), the potential target of a service performed by the company (normally a customer), or both.</p>
<p>The corresponding options are called:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete</p>
</li>
<li><p>Source</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Multiple Service Prov. Lines</em> field defines whether it is possible for more than one service provider to perform the same service (or service group) in the same region at the same time.</p>
<p>When selecting manually (e.g. from the sales order), all service providers saved in the system will be shown in this case.</p>
<p>When selecting automatically (e.g. via QuickDoc or status change or release code units), only one service provider will be recognized and that will be the last one that meets all of the criteria equally.</p>
<p>The <em>Apply Service Provision to</em> field defines the fields in the document line where the service provision selection should occur. However, the value in this optional field is only a default setting for the manual service provision selection in the sales quote, contract, or sales order. It will be overridden by any value in the field with the same name in the Service Provision Selection form.</p>
<p>Automatic service provision selection via <strong>QuickDoc</strong> always copies the value in the balance account (exception: business type = transport). When a function is called up directly from a programming code, the parameter has to be defined regarding which field in the selected service provider should be activated.</p>
<p>This logic is illustrated once again in the following overview:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-service-provision-matrix">Setting Up a Service Provision Matrix</h2>
<p>The Service Provision Matrix can be called by going to enwis Order Processing Setup Service Provision Matrix.</p>
<p>The service provision matrix controls which vendor and which vehicle can be deployed in which region for a specific service, and which customer the company provides its own services to.</p>
<p>The criteria for selecting the business partner are defined in the <em>Service Group</em>, <em>Service No.</em>, <em>Region Code</em>, <em>Service Provision Type</em>, and <em>Start Date</em> fields.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to meet all of these criteria in each line. Users could, for example, only work with the service groups or only with the service groups and region codes, or use different criteria where they are needed.</p>
<p>The lines in the service provision matrix normally contain a service group, even if it has not be explicitly displayed. Each line is assigned to the most recently displayed service group, shown in bold.</p>
<p>For reasons of clarity, the service group is not shown on each line; rather the lines are grouped together.</p>
<p>This requires that a <em>Service Group Code</em> be assigned to the service in the field of the same name.</p>
<p>The service parameters (service group, region code, etc.) are assigned to the corresponding service providers using the <em>Business Type</em>, <em>Business Partner</em>, <em>Business Partner Site</em>, and <em>Invoice Code</em> fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The business type &quot;Vendor&quot; can be assigned to a vendor and its order address</p>
</li>
<li><p>The business type &quot;Customer&quot; can be assigned to a customer and its task site</p>
</li>
<li><p>The business type &quot;Vehicle&quot; can be assigned to an internal vehicle to be selected for the performance of a service</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-provision-selection-in-the-document">Service Provision Selection in the Document</h2>
<p>Manual service provision selection can be called up in the document lines by going to</p>
<p><em>Actions (Alt + F10)</em></p>
<p><em>Line</em></p>
<p><em>Service
Provision Selection</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When a service has been assigned to a service group, this does not need to be entered manually. The service group is automatically copied over with the service.</p>
</div>
<p>The service provision selection is filtered by the service group, the service number, and the task date on the document line, as well as the dispatching group code of the task site or order address or of the vendor or customer on the document line (or the document header if there is one).</p>
<p>Users can select the right service provider and copy its corresponding information into the posting or balance account fields in the document line.</p>
<p>Where the information is copied to is controlled by the <em>Apply Service Provision to</em> field (see point 2 under the Default Settings for more information).</p>
<p>Users can apply the <em>Service Provision Type Filter</em> criteria to limit the choice of services.</p>
<p>When the selection is confirmed by clicking on &quot;OK&quot;, enwis copies the source to the <em>Bal. Acc. Post-with No.</em> field and, if appropriate, to the <em>Bal. Acc. Task Site</em> field.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-service-provision-selection-via-quickdoc">Automatic Service Provision Selection via QuickDoc</h2>
<p>When creating documents in <strong><em>QuickDoc</em></strong>, service provision selection can be executed automatically in the background.</p>
<p>This function is activated in the <em>Find Service Provider</em> field under the Contract
tab of the <strong><em>Dispatching Code Card</em></strong>. Go to</p>
<p><em>enwis
Workflow/Administration/Dispatching Codes</em></p>
<p>to call up dispatching codes.</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Option</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Never</td>
<td>No automatic service provision selection occurs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>On Upload</td>
<td>Automatic service provision selection is initiated when loading QuickDoc (i.e., before showing the record).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>On Write Back</td>
<td>Automatic service provision selection is initiated when clicking on OK to leave QuickDoc (and create the document).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Always</td>
<td>Automatic service provision selection is initiated both when loading and when leaving QuickDoc.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Automatic service provision selection within the scope of QuickDoc basically only copies your results to the <em>Bal. Acc.</em> fields and the <em>Vehicle No.</em> field (depending on the business type). For more information on this topic, see point 2 under Default Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Automatic Service Provision Selection via QuickDoc can only occur if the type of document line is Service, when there is a Service No., and when the <em>Post-with No.</em> field is filled.</strong></p>
<p>If a sales order is created using QuickDoc based on a task site, the balance account fields are automatically filled.</p>
<p>If the selected task site is labeled with a dispatching group code, enwis will decide the service provider responsible for this region and that also meets the other selection criteria.</p>
<p>The following Service Provision Selection form illustrates this relationship.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If multiple service providers meet the service criteria (see <em>Multiple Service Prov. Lines</em> field in Dispatching Setup (see point 2 under Default Settings), automatic service provision selection selects the last service provider.</p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>Services are the core of the commercial aspects of enwis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In principle, it is always services that are bought and sold</p>
</li>
<li><p>The only billable order lines are those recording services</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prices can only be saved for services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes services indispensable for depicting the commercial processes of waste management and recycling companies. Therefore, services are the enwis version of the default items in MS Business Central.</p>
<p>On the other hand, services can also be linked with all other operating resources and procedures associated with service performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Services can be entered with waste materials</p>
</li>
<li><p>Services can be saved in person and transport groups</p>
</li>
<li><p>Services can be linked to equipment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simple operating but non-billable expenses can be recorded in services</p>
</li>
<li><p>Services can be set up so that they trigger an entire cascade of additional services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The way these two aspects are associated with each other, that is, the service aspect relevant for invoicing and the one relevant to operations, can be entirely, freely defined by the users.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Users might define a service as &quot;Lump Sum Waste Disposal Petrol Station&quot; and link this with the waste material &quot;Used Oil&quot;, the transport group &quot;Oil Catch Tank&quot;, and the person group &quot;Driver&quot;.</p>
<p>Users can decide however they want the various aspects of this service to appear in the customer's invoice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time required as measured in hours</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quantity of material disposed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lump sum per task</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What follows is an explanation of how to set up a service.</p>
<h2 id="register-general">Register General</h2>
<p>The main fields on the General
register are as follows:</p>
<p>Each service has a unique identifying number that is entered into the &quot;Number&quot; field; this is how the service is addressed in the document line.</p>
<p>When numbering services, keep in mind that a service catalog is frequently quite comprehensive and can easily contain several hundred or several thousand entries. The service number can help give the service catalog some structure. It might therefore make sense not to set up enwis to fully automatically assign service numbers, but rather than do this manually and systematically so that users can more easily identify them.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The numbering for all waste management services could start from 100010, while all equipment services start from 200010.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When entering the service card in this example, then the user only needs to decide whether the service involves waste management or equipment, and then corresponding number is assigned automatically.</strong></p>
<p>Freely chosen text can be entered into the <em>Description</em> and <em>Description 2</em> fields to describe the content of each service.</p>
<p>The unit of measure used internally for recording the service is stored in the <em>Base Unit of Measure Code</em> field, e.g. the unit &quot;ton&quot; for waste management services or the unit &quot;hour&quot; for transport services, etc.</p>
<p>enwis automatically copies the value entered into <em>Base Unit of Measure Code</em> in the service card to the <em>Sales Unit of Measure Code</em> and <em>Purch. Unit of Measure Code</em> fields under the Invoicing
tab.</p>
<p>enwis thereby offers the option to use different units of measure for the same service, so that internal operating procedures can employ different units of measure for invoicing customers and suppliers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p>**Waste management services are recorded internally in tons but billed to the customer in m</p>
<p><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>.**</p>
<p>If the <em>Process Service</em> box in the service is checked, then this service is not usable in normal order transactions, because it is not addressable in the order lines.</p>
<p>Such &quot;process services&quot; are only designed to record company-internal expenses associated with an order line through a process ledger or through cost or price entries. This is why the system blocks them from being used as billable services in the order lines.</p>
<p>Users can assign a delivery code to a service in the <em>Base Delivery Code</em> field. There are no restrictions on delivery codes. They can be used, for example, to define the form or the type of transport normally used to render a waste management services (flat-bed truck, container, vacuum truck, etc.).</p>
<p>Delivery codes are part of the pricing criteria, i.e. different prices can be stored for the same service depending on the delivery code.</p>
<p>Assigning different delivery codes to a service has to be done manually on the document line, because the service itself will only copy one delivery code, assuming any have been assigned to it. The one saved in the service as the base delivery code will be copied over to the order line, but there it can be manually overwritten if needed.</p>
<p>The value entered in the Posting Type field, be it empty, &quot;Purchasing&quot;, or &quot;Sales&quot;, will control the field with the same name on the document line. This will define whether the service involved is for customers or vendors.</p>
<p>If the <em>Posting Type</em> field here is left empty, the content in the <em>Posting Type</em> field on the document line will be controlled by the document header. If there is a customer in the header of the sales order, then all order lines recording services with an empty <em>Posting Type</em> field will automatically be set to the posting type &quot;Sales&quot;.</p>
<p>The <em>Bill of Resources</em> field cannot be edited directly. enwis will automatically enter the value &quot;Yes&quot; in this field when users establish a link between the service and a bill of resources by going to</p>
<p><em>Associated Information</em></p>
<p><em>Service</em></p>
<p><em>Bill of
Resources</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <em>Auto-Explode Components</em> field can be edited directly. Checking this box means that the components saved in the bill of resources will be automatically copied over to the document.</p>
<p>The <em>Cascade Components</em> field has a similar function. To understand cascading, remember that the components in the bill of resources of a service might also contain other services, and these services might also have a bill of resources with other components; when cascading, the components of both the original service and these associated services are all copied over.</p>
<p>More information on the topic of the Bill of Resources can be found in the separate documentation.</p>
<p>By going to</p>
<p><em>Associated Information</em></p>
<p><em>Service</em></p>
<p><em>Extended Text</em></p>
<p>, users can assign one or more extended text lines to each service; these lines are distinguished by starting date and they will be copied over to their own document lines.</p>
<p>This can be set up to occur automatically when the service is validated in the document. To do so, check the <em>Automatic Ext. Texts</em> box on the service card.</p>
<p>By default, the <em>Search Description</em> field on the service card is filled with the value from the <em>Description</em> field. However, this can be overwritten to include any entry.</p>
<p>Services can be classified though the use of the <em>Service Group Code</em> field.</p>
<p>This field is critical for generating automated rental invoices.</p>
<p>The optional <em>Service Type</em> field mainly controls the relationship between operating quantities and invoice quantities and therefore has an indirect influence on the generation of service entries for a document line.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>If the service type &quot;Waste Management&quot; is assigned to the service &quot;Construction Waste Management&quot;, then enwis interprets entries in the <em>Operational Qty.</em> field in the <em>order line</em> as waste quantity and copies this value to the <em>Qty. to Dispose</em> field in the order line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then enwis uses the service type to decide what kind of operational quantity is involved and, for example, automatically creates a waste management entry for a waste management line without the user having to switch to the <em>Qty. to Dispose</em> field or the entry.</strong></p>
<p>In principle, the service type should be based on the billable core of the service, i.e. an equipment service should sensibly contain the service type &quot;Equipment&quot; because this is critical for its operational processing and also for the equipment entry in the invoice. For more information on this, see the &quot;Line Entries&quot; documentation.</p>
<p>Users can assign a dispatching code to each service in the <em>Dispatching Code</em> field. The disposition code controls the appearance and design of the enwis <strong><em>QuickDoc</em></strong> sales order form. It also determines how much employees are authorized to change the contracts when creating sales orders in enwis QuickDoc. For more information on this, see the &quot;Dispatching Code&quot; documentation.</p>
<p>Users can assign a waste material to the service in the <em>Waste Material Code</em> field. The waste material of the service is automatically copied to the document lines where the service is validated. Naturally, this is mainly useful for waste management services.</p>
<p>The code for the associated equipment is saved in the <em>Equipment No.</em> field.</p>
<p>Here it is important to understand that this does not refer to the individual number of the actual piece of equipment, but rather to a group of identical equipment. For example, the equipment number ARC700 might refer to all roller containers with a volume of seven cubic meters.</p>
<p>The equipment number will be copied to all document lines where the service is validated. Naturally, this is mainly useful for dropping off and picking up equipment.</p>
<p>The type and direction of equipment movement is set in the optional <em>Equipment Type</em></p>
<p>field.</p>
<p>The equipment types &quot;Drop Off&quot; and &quot;Pick Up&quot; are crucial for rental invoices. The equipment type &quot;Drop Off&quot; opens an equipment ledger entry that later needs to be closed and balanced out with a &quot;Pick Up&quot; entry. All services relevant to equipment rental should therefore be assigned a corresponding equipment type. For more information on this, see the &quot;Equipment Movements&quot; documentation.</p>
<p>Checking the <em>Blocked</em> box will block services for operational usage. Blocked services can no longer be validated in the documents, i.e. the sales quotes, contracts, and sales orders.</p>
<p>There is one thing to remember, though: If the service has already been saved in a contract line before being blocked, any number of new sales orders or order lines can be generated from this contract line despite the block. To prevent this from happening, go to <strong><em>Waste Management Setup</em></strong> under the Contract
tab and check the <em>Block Contracts w. Cust. /Vend.</em> box. This will prevent blocked services from repeatedly being copied over from contracts to sales orders.</p>
<h2 id="register-invoicing">Register Invoicing</h2>
<p>The main fields under the Invoicing
register are shown below:</p>
<p>Checking the <em>Do Not Invoice</em> box will prevent the order lines from being included in combine invoicing. This is useful for services that are shown on the customer's invoice, such as the use of certain special vehicles, equipment or employees, but that are not billed separately.</p>
<p>When services whose <em>Do Not Invoice</em> box is checked are validated in document lines, the document <em>Invoice</em> field is set to &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>Up to 3 characters can normally be entered into the <em>On Hold</em> field of a service, e.g. the initials of the employee, in order to temporarily prevent newly created order lines with this service. The service can still be used for operational purposes, but order lines with this service will be ignored when combine invoicing. This makes it possible to temporarily block services from invoicing and, when needed, release them for invoicing again.</p>
<p>The <em>Gen. Prod. Posting Group</em> and <em>VAT Class</em> fields are used to manage the posting of sales and purchase prices and the associated VAT to the corresponding general ledger accounts. See the standard training materials from MS Business Central to find out the significance of and how to set up these posting groups.</p>
<p>In regard to enwis it is only important that the posting groups in the service card represent real posting groups that actually manage the posting of revenues and costs in the G/L accounts. Unlike a lot of the master data in enwis (e.g. equipment), where the system routinely prompts the users to enter the posting groups, the posting groups on the services card are the central element that links the operating business to the general ledger accounts.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on the codes entered in the <em>Sales Delivery Code</em> and <em>Purch. Delivery Code</em> fields. It is up to the users whether and how delivery codes are used in the daily business of creating and processing sales orders.</p>
<p>Note, however, that delivery codes may be used as a pricing criterion. It is sufficient to record the corresponding delivery code in the order line and then save a price in the Service Prices table for both combinations.</p>
<p>It only makes sense to save these in the service card if specific services are constantly being linked to specific delivery codes in the real business processes.</p>
<p>Units of measurement that are typically used for measuring the invoiced quantities but that differ from the base unit of measure code can be saved in the <em>Sales Unit of Measure Code</em> and <em>Purch. Unit of Measure Code</em> fields.</p>
<p>If invoicing is normally done using the unit of &quot;Piece&quot; but the stock is usually kept in the unit &quot;Ton&quot;, then &quot;Ton&quot; is defined as the base unit of measurement for the service, while &quot;Piece&quot; is saved as the purchasing or sales unit of measurement.</p>
<p>A conversion code between the two units of measurement can be linked to the service.</p>
<p>The same applies for the <em>Sales Rental Invoice UOM</em> and <em>Purch. Rental Invoice UOM</em> fields, which are mainly used for rental services.</p>
<p>It makes sense to use &quot;Day&quot; as the base unit of measure for rental invoices, though leased equipment might be invoiced in hours, days, weeks, or months.</p>
<p>These various time units can be saved in a rental service just like the conversion code, which sets the conversion between the invoicing unit of measurement and the base unit of measurement.</p>
<p>The <em>Cycle Code</em> field can be used for cyclic document creation. Cyclic Document creation allows recurring sales orders to be automatically created from contracts. If there is a set relationship between a service and its regular performance, it makes sense to save a cycle code directly in the service so that it can be copied over automatically when the service is validated in the contract lines. For more information on this, see the &quot;Cyclic Document Creation Setup&quot; documentation.</p>
<p>In the Concept No. field, a service can be linked with a concept, so that the concept is copied over when the service is validated in the documents. When business transactions involve multiple business partners, concepts in enwis serve to allocate the service quantities, costs, and revenues among the partners involved. For more information on this, see the &quot;Concepts&quot; documentation.</p>
<p>The <em>Cost Center Code</em> and <em>Cost Object Code</em> fields can be used to associate the service with cost centers and cost objects that will be copied when the services are validated in the documents. Cost centers and cost objects are dimensions in MS Business Central and there setup is described in the corresponding standard training documentation.</p>
<h2 id="register-handling">Register Handling</h2>
<p>The main fields under the Handling
register are shown below:</p>
<p>The <em>Transfer Description 2</em> field on the service card manages whether the content in the <em>Description 2</em> field on the service card will be copied to a document line or not. The following options are available:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Always</th>
<th>The content in the Description 2 field of the service will always be copied to the document line.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>If Empty</td>
<td>The content in the <em>Description 2</em> field of the service will only be copied to the document line if the <em>Description 2</em> field in the document line is not yet filled. If a service is validated in an empty document line, then the content from the <em>Description 2</em> field will be copied over. If another service is then validated in the same line, the content of its <em>Description 2</em> field will not be copied as long as the option &quot;If Empty&quot; has been saved in its <em>Transfer Description 2</em> field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Never</td>
<td>The content in the <em>Description 2</em> field will never be copied from the service to the document line. The content in the <em>Description 2</em> field of the document line will never be filled with the content from the current service.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Use the <em>Dispatch for Weighbridge</em> field on the service card to manage how the system should behave in the <em>Weighbridge Dispatching</em> field of the <strong><em>document line</em></strong> when the service is validated.</p>
<p>Only order lines with a <em>Weighbridge Dispatching</em> field set to &quot;Weigh&quot; will be made available to the weighing operator as a sales order to be weighed.</p>
<p>The individual options in the <em>Dispatch For Weighbridge</em> field on the service card manages whether the &quot;Weigh&quot; option is set in only customers' order lines, only vendors' order lines or both when the corresponding service is validated.</p>
<h2 id="register-foreign-trade">Register Foreign Trade</h2>
<p>The main fields under the Export
register are shown below:</p>
<p>The <em>Tariff No.</em>, <em>Country of Origin Code</em>, and <em>Net Weight</em> fields on the service card were copied by enwis from the default item card in MS Business Central.</p>
<p>These fields are relevant for customs declarations in the Export department. See the corresponding training documentation from MS Business Central for more information about their use.</p>
<h2 id="register-indexing">Register Indexing</h2>
<p>The main fields under the Keywords
register are show below:</p>
<p>The Keywords tab offers the option of saving a keyword catalog for each service describing the main characteristics of that service. Using this list of keywords, all services can then be filtered to show only those that meet specific characteristics, e.g. all services with a certain waste material, or a combination of specific characteristics.</p>

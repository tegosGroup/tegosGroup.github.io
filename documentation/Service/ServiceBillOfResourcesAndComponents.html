<h1 id="service-bill-of-resources-and-components">Service Bill of Resources and Components</h1>

<h2 id="service-bill-of-resources">Service Bill of Resources</h2>
<p>Users can assign any number of service components to each service by going to</p>
<p><em>Navigate</em></p>
<p><em>Service</em></p>
<p><em>Bill of
Resources</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The service bill of resources can be used, for example, to minimize and standardize the work of recording services in the documents and thereby reduce incorrect entries.</p>
<p>The components stored in the service bill of resources can be copied automatically to the documents. This is dependent on the setting in the <em>Auto-Explode Components</em> field on the <strong><em>service card</em></strong>. The components of the service bill of resources are only copied automatically to the documents when this box is checked.</p>
<p>If this box is not checked, it is still possible to initiate the manual transfer from the service bill of resources to the document using the</p>
<p><em>Explode Components</em></p>
<p>function.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If the service bill of resources is primarily intended to minimize the effort of data entry for sales orders and to ensure all information is recorded, then the <em>Auto-Explode Components</em> field should regularly be checked.
Working with automatically exploding components simplifies and standardizes sales order records greatly and eliminates potential sources of error.</p>
</div>
<p>The transfer from the bill of resources to the documents is handled in two different ways. This difference depends on the type of bill of resources component:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Components of the Service and Item type are transferred to additional document lines</p>
</li>
<li><p>Components of the Person, Equipment, Transport, Costs, and Surcharge type are transferred to the corresponding entries on the document lines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes the most sense to work with a bill of resources when all operating costs related to order processing are systematically recorded in the form of ledger entries.</p>
<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Normally, for example, a specific vehicle type and at least one driver are necessary for waste management services. Therefore, it would be expedient to give each waste management service two bill of resources components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a transport group</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>a personnel group</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <em>Auto-Explode Components</em> box on the service card should be checked. This setting ensures that a transport entry and a personnel entry will be recorded for each service.</strong></p>
<p>By also setting the <em>Check Transport Entry</em> and <em>Check Personnel Entry</em> fields under the Entries
tab in <strong>Waste Management Setup</strong> to the option &quot;Purchases&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot;, users ensure that sales orders with these services cannot be released until these entries have been filled in, i.e. not until the driver, vehicle, and concrete task duration has been documented.</p>
<p>This is a quite easy but very effective way to guarantee that all essential information in a sales order has been entered when the service is validated and that the sales order cannot be closed until all service information has been completely recorded.</p>
<h2 id="service-components">Service Components</h2>
<p>The type and usage of the bill of resources components is defined in the <em>Type</em> field in the <strong><em>service bill of resources</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>Type</em> field controls the <em>No.</em> field in the service bill of resources. Depending on the setting in the <em>Type</em> field, the Lookup function will bring up different tables in the <em>No.</em> field (e.g. an equipment list).</p>
<p>Therefore, the <em>Type</em> field controls which component types can be stored in the <em>No.</em> field on the bill of resources line.</p>
<p>An explanation of the different options for the <em>Type</em> field follows:</p>
<h3 id="type-service">Type: Service</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up the <strong><em>service table</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more other services to the service in question using the service bill of resources.</p>
<p>The services in the bill of resources are transferred to additional document lines when exploded. Each service in the bill of resources that can be assigned to a different service might itself have a service bill of resources. A service bill of resources might therefore feature a series of services all embedded in a chain of any length.</p>
<p>It makes the most sense to save services in a service bill of resources when the main service is regularly associated with other services that might also need to be shown to the customer.</p>
<p>This spares users the sales order preparation task of always remembering, for example, that when adding the service &quot;fecal sludge waste disposal&quot;, they must manually add the associated service &quot;wash vehicle&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="type-person">Type: Person</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up <strong><em>personnel groups</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more personnel groups to the service in question using the service bill of resources.</p>
<p>These personnel groups in the bill of resources are transferred to personnel entries in the documents when exploded. The system leaves this personnel entry incomplete, however; users have to fill in the document line with the concrete employee number and task duration.</p>
<p>It makes sense to save personnel groups in a service bill of resources for all services</p>
<p>that are regularly associated with a personnel entry in the documents.</p>
<p>This is most expedient for services of the Person type, because the personnel group needed for the personnel entry can only be automatically assigned via the bill of resources.</p>
<h3 id="type-equipment">Type: Equipment</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up the <strong><em>equipment numbers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more pieces of equipment to the service in question using the service bill of resources.</p>
<p>When this is to be used to depict equipment transactions that affect stock, it makes sense to also edit the <em>Equipment Type</em> field in the service bill of resources, i.e., to indicate whether the transaction involves the drop-off, pick-up, exchange or emptying of equipment.</p>
<p>The equipment numbers and the equipment types in the bill of resources are transferred to equipment entries in the documents when exploded.</p>
<p>It makes the most sense to save equipment in a service bill of resources for all services where equipment may play a role but that are not specifically equipment services.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>All information relevant to setting up services of the &quot;Service&quot; type, e.g. particularly the equipment number and the equipment type, can be entered directly into the service card, making it superfluous to save this information in the service bill of resources.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="type-transport">Type: Transport</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up <strong><em>transport groups</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more transport groups to the service in question using the service bill of resources.</p>
<p>These transport groups in the bill of resources are transferred to transport entries in the documents when exploded.</p>
<p>The system leaves this transport entry incomplete, however; users have to fill in the document line with the concrete vehicle number and the task duration or distance.</p>
<p>It makes most sense to save transport groups in a service bill of resources for all services that are regularly associated with a transport entry in the documents.</p>
<p>This is especially necessary for Transport type services, because the transport group needed for the transport entry can only be automatically assigned via the bill of resources.</p>
<h3 id="type-item">Type: Item</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up the <strong><em>items</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more items to the service in question using the service bill of resources.</p>
<p>These items in the bill of resources are transferred to new lines in the document when exploded.</p>
<p>It makes most sense to save items in a service bill of resources when the items are a regular component needed to perform the service.</p>
<h3 id="type-costs">Type: Costs</h3>
<p>When this setting is used, the <em>No.</em> field brings up the <strong><em>service table</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This allows users to assign one or more &quot;cost services&quot; to the service in question using the service bill of resources in order to create cost/price entries in the documents.</p>
<p>These &quot;cost services&quot; in the bill of resources are transferred to cost/price entries in the documents when exploded.</p>
<p>Cost/price entries can be used to record company-internal costs when it does not make sense to document these costs in the form of equipment, transport, or personnel entries.</p>
<h3 id="type-surcharge-and-deduction">Type: Surcharge and Deduction</h3>
<p>When the Surcharge and Deduction settings are used in the <em>Type</em> field of the service bill of resources, surcharges and deductions to the service prices in the document line can be calculated and copied directly to the <em>Amount</em> field in the document line.</p>
<p>Certain settings are required to use these functions, as shown in the following example.</p>
<p>A bill of resources component of the Surcharge or Deduction type only needs information in the <em>Type</em> and <em>Value %</em> fields, and the <em>Description</em> field, for logical reasons, so that the users and the customer know what it involves.</p>
<p>The percentage value entered into the <em>Value %</em> field is the critical figure.</p>
<p>This percentage will be applied to the usual service price in the document line and is visible in the difference between the <em>price</em> and the <em>amount</em>.</p>
<p>Surcharges and deductions can be automatically or manually calculated, or not calculated at all. This setting is entered in <strong><em>Invoice Setup</em></strong> in the <em>Calc. Surcharge/Deduction</em> field under the General
tab.</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Never: Surcharges and deductions are not calculated and therefore not copied to the document line</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manual: Surcharges and deductions calculations can only be triggered manually in the document by clicking on the</p>
<p><em>Calc. Surcharge/Deduction</em></p>
<p>icon</p>
</li>
<li><p>During Pricing: Surcharges and deductions are calculated automatically for the document line when pricing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always: Surcharges and deductions are also applied to prices entered manually into the document line</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The source of this difference is not visible on the document line; it is not revealed until users switch to the cost/price entry associated with the line, where the Surcharge/Deduction Type information in the service components has been transferred to.</p>
<h2 id="process-type">Process Type</h2>
<p>The <em>Process Type</em> field in the service bill of resources is normally only used in connection with Service type bill of resources components. The field features two options: &quot;Process&quot; and &quot;Allocation&quot;.</p>
<p>When a bill of resources with Service type components featuring the Process Type setting &quot;Process&quot; is exploded in the document, additional document lines with non-billable process services are created;</p>
<p>these new lines allow the juxtaposition of revenues and costs directly in the document.</p>
<p>Document lines of the Process Costs process type are always non-billable. Users can identify them by the fact that the <em>Invoice</em> box is not checked.</p>
<p>Posting process service lines does not create any invoice ledger entries, but rather process cost entries, which can be reported separately.</p>
